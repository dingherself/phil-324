# Week 5: *Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk* (10th Cir. 2020)

Last week, we introduced Kimberlé Crenshaw’s now-classic critique of the courts’ failure to conceptualize intersectional discrimination against Black women. Then, in this week’s modules, we considered two more intersectional forms of discrimination—sexual harassment (sex/gender, sexuality, and class) and LGBTQ+ discrimination (sex/gender, sexual orientatition, and gender identity).

While Crenshaw’s work has been extraordinarily influential in legal theory and beyond, courts are still struggling to catch up, even three decades later. Since *Bostock*, however, legal scholars have wondered if the *Bostock*-style analysis could help with this uptake problem. For our discussion this week, we will consider the 10th Circuit’s state-of-the-art analysis of employment discrimination on an intersectional sex-and-age basis. One particularly interesting aspect of the 10th Circuit’s analysis in [*Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk*](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/010110379793.pdf) is that the court held that intersectional sex-and-age discrimination could still violate Title VII even if the text of Title VII does not expressly include age as a protected characteristic.

*Frappied* is a very complex case, and you’ll want to keep close track of four different issues:

- A disparate treatment claim under Title VII;
- A disparate impact claim under Title VII;
- A disparate treatment claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA); and
- A disparate impact claim under ADEA.

The distinction between disparate treatment and disparate impact came up in MacKinnon’s discussion, but we will didn’t formally introduce it. So let me give you a very rough overview: Disparate treatment and disparate impact are two standard theories in mainstream discrimination law for when something constitutes a case of discrimination. For there to be discrimination under the disparate treatment theory, the employer must *intentionally* treat similarly situated persons differently on the basis of a protected characteristic (e.g., age under ADEA or race/color/religion/sex/national origin under Title VII). In contrast, the disparate impact theory does not require a discriminatory intent. In Title VII cases, for example, an employment policy or practice that is “facially neutral” (i.e., not overtly discriminatory) can still violate Title VII if it *disproportionate affects* one of the protected groups and is not justified by a *business necessity*. The disparate impact theory is also avaliable under ADEA. (But in *Washington v. Davis* (1976), the Supreme Court held that there is no disparate impact theory for racial discrimination claims under the Equal Protection Clause.)

**Please read the 10th Circuit’s opinion linked above. Do you think the *Bostock*-style analysis, as illustrated by both *Bostock* itself and its application in *Frappied*, provides an adequate solution to the analytical challenges posed by intersectional discrimination?**
