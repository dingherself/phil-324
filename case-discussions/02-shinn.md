# Week 2: Shinn v. Ramirez (2022)

The Suspension Clause in Article I of the Constitution provides:

> The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.

By issuing writs of habeas corpus, federal courts can order the release of unlawfully detained persons. Most relevant to our discussion here, this gives defendants convicted of a crime in state court a constitutional right to challenge the lawfulness of their state court conviction in federal court.

But this right was severely restricted by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). One of the restrictions concerns the introduction of new evidence. The provision in question, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2), prohibits federal courts from even hearing evidence for a claim that the defendent “has failed to develop the factual basis of . . . in State court proceedings.”

In our case, Mr. Barry Jones’s trial attorneys were so incompetent that they failed to investigate and present readily available evidence of Mr. Jones’s innocence, leading to his first-degree murder conviction and death sentence in the Pima County Superior Court, based here in Tucson, Arizona. The Arizona Supreme Court subsequently affirmed. In the state post-conviction stage, Mr. Jones’s state-appointed post-conviction attorney—who, by the way, did not meet the minimum qualifications required by Arizona law—in turn failed to investigate the trial attorneys’ failure to investigate, leading to the denial of post-conviction relief by Arizona state courts. Now, in the federal post-conviction stage, Mr. Jones’s federal habeas corpus attorneys were finally competent enough to realize the spectacular incompetence of his previous attorneys. They argued successfully before the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona that because Mr. Jones’s right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment was violated, he is entitled to habeas corpus relief. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit then upheld the federal district court’s consideration of the evidence that Mr. Jones’s trial and post-conviction counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective.

But the state argued that Section 2254(e)(2) prohibited the federal district court from doing just that. At oral argument before the U.S. Supreme Court, Arizona’s Solicitor General Brunn Roysden III went so far as to suggest that “even innocence is not enough” for getting around Section 2254(e)(2) to release Mr. Jones. In the consolidated cases that became *Shinn v. Ramirez*, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed, leaving Mr. Jones on Arizona’s death row.

For our purposes, we will focus on Mr. Jones’s case. But as you can already tell, even his case is very technically and procedurally complex. So, instead of reading the opinion itself, we will rely on the Strict Scrutiny podcast’s relatively accessible summary and commentary, which you can listen to [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ToyAfhItAl9NNXCL8g7bF) (the relevant segment starts at 04:18; a transcript is available [here](https://crooked.com/podcast/innocence-isnt-enough/)).

Here is our discussion question: **How would Hart, Fuller, and Dworkin each analyze the legality of the federal district court’s decision to consider evidence that Mr. Jones’s trial and post-conviction counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective, in light of Section 2254(e)(2)? Do you think any of them would be right about that, and why or why not?**

(P.S. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, Mr. Jones’s current attorneys, through truly outstanding advocacy, managed to reach a settlement agreement with the state and finally [secured his release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmM97a86kx5WtwxHkhtE1UBquNDcTxkrsWWUOl09B6o/edit) in June 2023, nearly three decades after his wrongful conviction.)
