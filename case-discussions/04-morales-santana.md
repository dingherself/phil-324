# Week 4: *Sessions v. Morales-Santana* (2017)

A persistent problem with the Court’s approach to gender equality is the analysis of purported real sex differences. In our discussion of MacKinnon, for example, we encountered the Court’s treatment of pregnancy: discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, *Geduldig* and *Gilbert* held, is not discrimination on the basis of sex because pregnancy is an inherent difference that’s unique but not universal to women.

Federal immigration law is another area where the Court has struggled with purported real sex differences. In a 2001 case, *Tuan Anh Nguyen v. Immigration and Naturalization Service*, the Court upheld a federal law imposing three additional citizenship requirements for a child born abroad to an unmarried citizen father and non-citizen mother, as compared to a child born abroad to an unmarried citizen mother and non-citizen father:

- The “blood relationship” must be “established by clear and convincing evidence.”
- The father must agree in writing “to provide financial support for the [child] until the [child] reaches the age of 18 years.”
- The paternity must also be formally recognized by the child’s 18th birthday.

Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy leaned on “the significant difference between [a mother’s and a father’s] relationships to the potential citizen at the time of birth” in two respects:

- First, while the “biological parent-child relationship” between the mother and the child “is verifiable from the birth itself,” the father “need not be present at the birth.”
- Second, while “the opportunity for a meaningful relationship between citizen [mother] and child inheres in the very event of birth,” such an “opportunity does not result from the event of birth, as a matter of biological inevitability, in the case of the unwed father.”

Both women then on the Court dissented. Justice O’Connor’s dissent strongly contested the assertion of “biological inevitability”:

- In response to the biological parent-child relationship argument, Justice O’Connor pointed out that “a mother will not always have formal legal documentation of birth because a birth certificate may not issue or may subsequently be lost. Conversely, a father’s name may well appear on a birth certificate. . . . [T]he majority has not shown that a mother’s birth relation is uniquely verifiable *by the INS*, much less that any greater verifiability warrants a sex-based, rather than a sex-neutral, statute.”
- And in response to the meaningful relationship argument, Justice O’Connor wrote that the argument “finds support not in biological differences but instead in a stereotype—i.e., ‘the generalization that mothers are significantly more likely than fathers . . . to develop caring relationships with their children.’”

The case we will discuss this week follows up on this 2001 decision. [*Sessions v. Morales-Santana* (2017)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1191_2a34.pdf) concerned another differential requirement:

- Federal immigration law confers citizenship to a child born abroad to a citizen parent *married* to a non-citizen parent if the citizen parent was physically present in the United States for 10 years (at least 5 of which must be after the citizen parent’s 14th birthday) prior to the child’s birth.
- While the same physical presence requirement applies to a child born aboard to an *unmarried citizen father*, Congress made an exception for unmarried citizen *mothers* such that “a continuous period of one year” is sufficient.

This time, the Court found the differential requirement unconstitutional, but it got hung up on remedies: for the Court, Justice Ginsburg wrote that the right thing to do here was to strike down the shortened period for unmarried citizen mothers, such that the longer period would apply across the board—indeed, Justice Ginsburg argued that this was necessitated “by the legislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand.”

**Please read Justice Ginsburg’s majority opinion in *Morales-Santana* linked above (be smart about which parts to skim!). In light of our class discussion this week, how do you think MacKinnon would respond to *Morales-Santana*? Would you agree with her, and why or why not?**
