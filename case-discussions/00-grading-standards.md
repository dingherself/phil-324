| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Motive and Thesis*          | The discussion **introduces** the question asked by the prompt. <br /><br />The discussion then offers an **answer** (that is, the *thesis*) in response to the question. | The discussion introduces the question asked by the prompt. The presentation of the question is **largely clear**.<br /><br />The discussion then offers an answer (that is, the *thesis*) in response to the question. The statement of the thesis is **largely clear**. | The discussion introduces the question asked by the prompt. Not only is the presentation of the question **clear and well-focused**, but it also **motivates the question in an engaging, compelling, and sophisticated way**.<br /><br />The discussion then offers an answer (that is, the *thesis*) in response to the question. The statement of the thesis is **clear, well-focused, and easily recognizable**. The thesis itself is also both **arguable** (i.e., not obviously true/false) and **insightful** (e.g., building on but extending beyond the lectures). |
| *Key Terms and Concepts*     | Key terms and concepts are **for the most part consistently and accurately employed** throughout the discussion. | Key terms and concepts are **consistently, accurately, and carefully** employed throughout the discussion. They are also **for the most part clearly and accurately explained**. | Key terms and concepts are consistently, accurately, and carefully employed throughout the discussion. They are also **clearly and accurately explained and introduced where relevant and helpful to the development of an overarching line of argument, with reference to the case and course readings where appropriate**. When a key term or concept is abstract, complex, or otherwise not obvious, it is **carefully and thoughtfully illustrated** with an example, analogy, diagram, or some other useful heuristic device. |
| *Evidence and Analysis*      | The discussion provides a **more or less accurate** description of the facts of the case, the issue(s) it raises, and the relevant arguments.<br /><br />The discussion **draws on** aspects of the case described to **develop an argument** for the thesis. | The discussion provides an **accurate and for the most part clear** description of the facts of the case, the issue(s) it raises, and the relevant arguments.<br ><br >The discussion **integrates** its description of the case into an argument for the thesis. The argument itself is **for the most part clear and supported by the evidence cited**. | The discussion provides an **accurate, clear, engaging, and well-organized** description of the facts of the case, the issue(s) it raises, and the relevant arguments. The description is **selective in its inclusion and exclusion of details** and demonstrates a **deep understanding** of the case.<br ><br >The discussion not only integrates its description of the case into an argument for the thesis but also **draws out—and where appropriate, engages with—challenges and complications that the case presents for the argument**. The argument itself is **clear, well-reasoned, and well-supported by the evidence cited**. |
| *Structure and Organization* | The discussion **follows some logical structure**, even if the structure may be forced in a rather mechanical or otherwise awkward way. | The discussion follows a **largely coherent** logical structure that is **for the most part easy to follow**. In so doing, it **often employs sign-posting language**, especially at points of transition. | The discussion follows a **coherent, progressive logical structure** that is **easy to follow** and **contributes to the development of an overarching line of argument**. In so doing, it **consistently employs** sign-posting language, especially at points of transition. |
| *Style and Clarity*          | The discussion **for the most part follows basic conventions of academic and philosophical writing on diction and voice** (e.g., it is expected that you will use appropriate philosophical and legal terms and refer to yourself in the first person), even if there may be significant obscurities that impede understanding. | The discussion **consistently follows** basic conventions of academic and philosophical writing on diction and voice (e.g., it is expected that you will use appropriate philosophical and legal terms and refer to yourself in the first person). The discussion is composed in **largely clear** prose, with occasional obscurities that impede understanding. | The discussion consistently follows basic conventions of academic and philosophical writing on diction and voice (e.g., it is expected that you will use appropriate philosophical and legal terms and refer to yourself in the first person). The discussion is composed in **clear, engaging, and well-chosen** prose, with few to no obscurities that impede understanding. |
