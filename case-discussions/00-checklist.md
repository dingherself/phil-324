# Checklist for the Case Discussion Assignment

To earn a **check**, your discussion must address all elements of the prompt, demonstrate a clear grasp of the relevant course materials, and show a serious effort to develop a thoughtful, reasoned analysis of the case:

- *Motive*: The discussion should introduce the question asked by the prompt and offer an explicit answer (that is, the *thesis*) in response to the question;
- *Key Terms*: The discussion should establish and explain the relevant technical terms, rather than taking them for granted.
- *Argument*: The discussion should defend its thesis by articulating reasons, considerations, and principles that not just the author, but everybody should be expected to accept.
- *Evidence*: The discussion should integrate, mostly through paraphrases, both factual evidence from the case itself and textual evidence from our assigned readings at relevant places to help develop its analysis.
- *Sources*: The discussion should represent its sources accurately and mostly charitably.
- *Structure*: The discussion should follow a logical structure and employ sign-posting language at points of transition.
- *Style*: The discussion should be composed in largely clear and straightforward prose, with no more than occasional obscurities that impede understanding.

To earn a **check-plus**, your discussion must demonstrate sophistication by going over and beyond the expectations for a check in at least one significant aspect. For example,

- The discussion may craft a particularly insightful thesis that indicates a deep and sophisticated grasp of the case and the course materials.
- The discussion may provide a particularly compelling argument of its thesis with an original example, idea, or application of a theory.
- The discussion may develop a particularly nuanced analysis by demonstrating sophisticated awareness of, and where appropriate, engaging with countervailing considerations, competing views, and additional complications.
- The discussion may be particularly well-executed: it is crystal clear, easy to follow, a joy to read, and yet nuanced and sophisticated.
