# Checklist for the Case Discussion Assignment

To earn a *check*, your discussion must adequately answer the question asked by the prompt by (1) covering all elements of the prompt, (2) demonstrating a clear grasp of the relevant course materials as applied to the case, and (3) showing a serious, good-faith effort to develop a thoughtful, reasoned, and structurally complete analysis of the case.

More specifically, here are the elements that make a satisfactory (check-level) discussion:

- *Motive*: The discussion should introduce the question asked by the prompt and offer an explicit answer (that is, the *thesis*) in response to the question;
- *Key Terms*: The discussion should establish and explain the relevant technical terms, rather than taking them for granted.
- *Evidence*: The discussion should integrate, mostly through paraphrases, both factual evidence from the case itself and textual evidence from our assigned readings at relevant places to help develop its analysis.
- *Analysis*: The discussion should make clear how the evidence it draws on in fact supports its claims; it should aim to articulate reasons, considerations, and principles that not just the author, but everybody should be expected to accept.
- *Sources*: The discussion should represent its sources accurately and mostly charitably.
- *Structure*: The discussion should follow a logical structure and employ sign-posting language at points of transition.
- *Style*: The discussion should be composed in largely clear and straightforward prose, with no more than occasional obscurities that impede understanding.

To earn a *check-plus*, your discussion must demonstrate *sophistication* by going over and beyond the expectations for a check in at least one significant way. For example,

- The discussion may craft a particularly insightful thesis that indicates a deep and nuanced grasp of the case and the course materials.
- The discussion may provide a particularly compelling argument of its thesis with an original example, idea, or application of a theory.
- The discussion may develop a particularly thoughtful analysis by demonstrating nuanced and careful awareness of, and where appropriate, engaging with countervailing considerations, competing views, and additional complications.
- The discussion may be particularly well-executed: it is crystal clear, easy to follow, a joy to read, and yet thoughtful and nuanced.
