# *Toomey v. Arizona* (D. Ariz. filed Jan. 23, 2019)

This week, we examined two further issues that, even though they directly bear on gender equality, are rarely considered as gender equality issues in their own right—reproductive freedom and transgender equality.

For our last discussion, we will apply these insights to an ongoing case here in Arizona, involving one of our own wildcats, Professor Russell B. Toomey, who teaches in the Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences at the University of Arizona. Arizona’s state employee health plan excludes coverage for medically necessary gender-affirming surgery, and Professor Toomey’s lawsuit challenges this exclusion under both Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause. The case has been in litigation for quite some time, and we will encounter many familiar arguments and issues here.

**Please read [Professor Toomey’s motion for summary judgment](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/14739642/298/toomey-v-arizona-state-of/) and [the State’s response in opposition](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/14739642/315/toomey-v-arizona-state-of/). In light of our discussions, do you think the State is right that the exclusion does not constitute discrimination on the basis of sex or transgender status in violation of Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause?**
