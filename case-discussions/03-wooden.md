# Wooden v. United States (2022)

On one evening in 1997, Mr. William Wooden broke into ten units at a storage facility right next to his house (see this [Google Maps photo](https://bit.ly/3sMQsKX) for what the storage facility is like – this is very important). He was subsequently indicted on ten counts of burglary, among other charges, and he pleaded guilty to all of them. He received a total sentence of eight years.

In 2014, Mr. Wooden was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The crime carries a maximum sentence of ten years, and the U.S. probation office recommended a sentence of 21 to 27 months within the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. The prosecutors, however, turned to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which mandates a fifteen-year *minimum* sentence for the felon-in-possession offense when the defendant “has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony . . . committed on occasions different from one another.” 18 U.S.C. §  924(e)(1).

A jury convicted Mr. Wooden of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The district court agreed with the prosecutors that Mr. Wooden’s burglary of the ten units in the same storage facility on the same night amounted to not one, but ten prior qualifying offenses “committed on occasions different from one another,” triggering the fifteen-year sentencing enhancement under ACCA. The district court sentenced Mr. Wooden to 188 months’ imprisonment, and a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed. The *en banc* Six Circuit denied rehearing.

Mr. Wooden then filed a cert petition *on his own*, managing to get the Supreme Court to grant it (he finally found attorneys to represent him in the merits stage). Writing for the Court, Justice Kagan found that the ten counts of burglary that Mr. Wooden was convicted of were not “committed on occasions different from one another” under ACCA.

**Discussion question: In light of our discussion of statutory interpretation, how do you think the phrase “committed on occasions different from one another” should be interpreted?**
