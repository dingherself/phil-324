# Assessment

This winter session is the fifth time I’ve taught the online version of this course, and a lesson I’ve learned but never figured out how best to implement is that the assessment tools useful for an in-person, discussion-based philosophy course do not work as well for our asynchronous, lecture-focused format.

This time, though, I’d like to try out a “build your own grade” system. My motivation here is that I want to make room for my students to genuinely learn and grow as philosophers, and I hope to do that by making grading as anxiety-inducing as possible for both non-traditional students and students who are learning about law and philosophy for the first time. Here is how the system works:

- All of the assignments in this class will be graded on a check-plus/check/check-minus (i.e., excellent/satisfactory/unsatisfactory) basis. You will receive a check on an assignment as long as you complete it as instructed; a check-plus will ask you to put in a lot more effort, and I will explain what that amounts to for each category of assignments.
- To earn a certain letter grade in the course (A, B, C …), you must complete all of the requirements for that letter grade as specified below.
- If you barely fail to meet the requirements for the next letter grade, you may choose to complete an extra credit assignment, described below, in order to make up for the missed requirement.

If at any point you have any questions about the logistics of the course, please don’t be afraid to reach out!

| D    | Earn at least a check on **six** of the ten required reading guides. | Earn at least a check on **six** of the ten required module quizzes. | Earn at least a check on one of the required case discussions. | Participate in the course in ways that for the most part demonstrate respect, support, and care for your classmates and instructor, **despite a pattern of disruptive, harassing, intimidating, or otherwise inappropriate behavior**. |

A grade of E/F will be assigned in cases where a student

1. fails to earn a check on six of the ten required reading guides;
2. fails to earn at least a check on six of the ten required module quizzes;
3. fails to earn at least a check on one of the required case discussions;
4. fails to demonstrate respect, support, and care for their classmates and instructor through behavior that threatens the safety of the class or otherwise seriously disrupts the classroom environment; or
5. fails to comply with course policies on academic integrity.

## Reading Guides

The **reading guides** are designed to walk you through the assigned readings by pointing you to the key concepts, distinctions, claims, and argumentative steps. Occasionally, I will also use the reading guides to explain the relevant philosophical or historical background. As you do the readings, please follow the questions on the reading guide and identify the relevant passages in the text that address them.

Some of the reading guide questions are **bolded**. If a question is bolded, you are asked to write out a brief answer in your own words (unless instructed otherwise). You don’t need to answer the question correctly in order to receive a check, but it must demonstrate at least reasonable, good-faith effort. You should not leave a bolded question unanswered, and you should never copy directly from my handouts—doing so does not show that *you* have tried to understand the reading. If a question is not bolded, you don’t need to answer it for purposes of a check.

If you would like to earn a check-plus on a reading guide, you are asked to

1. write the page numbers of the relevant passages next to the unbolded questions;
2. leave questions/comments/reactions to the reading as you answer the reading guide questions; and
3. go back to the reading guide after watching my lectures and revise your answers (please leave your original answer as is and use a different color or font to clearly identify the revision).

## Module Quizzes

For each module, there will be a **quiz** consisting of ten multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blanks, and/or matching questions. The purpose of the module quizzes is to check your understanding; they are not meant to be tricky. You will need to earn an 80% to receive a check on a quiz, and a 90% to receive a check-plus. If you receive at least a 60% but less than a 90%, you will have an opportunity to re-answer the questions you got wrong the first time.

## Case Discussions

The **case discussions** offer opportunities to apply what you have learned in class to current issues in the law in ways that build on but go beyond the lecture. You are asked to discuss four of the seven following cases, depending on which modules you elect to complete. I will provide instructions for each case.

1. *United States v. Higgs* (2021): this is one of a very disturbing series of death penalty cases that the Supreme Court disposed of on its shadow docket. (Modules 1 and 2)
2. *Shinn v. Ramirez* (2022): the Court upheld the death sentences of two Arizona men despite evidence that their trial counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective, because their post-conviction counsel was also too unconstitutionally ineffective to raise the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. (Modules 3 and 4)
3. *Wooden v. United States* (2022): the Court considered whether burgling ten storage units at the same storage facility on the same night amounts to not one, but ten different offenses that are “committed on occasions different from one another,” thereby triggering a 15-year mandatory sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) when the petitioner was later convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. (Module 5)
4. *Doe v. Mckesson* (5th Cir. 2023): the 5th Circuit decided that the organizer of a Black Lives Matter protest could be held liable for the injuries of a police officer even though he did not cause those injuries himself. (Module 6)
5. *Sessions v. Morales-Santana* (2017): Justice Ginsburg, for the Court, struck down a sex discriminatory federal immigration statute but still rejected the petitioner’s citizenship claim. (Modules 7 and 8)
6. *Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk* (10th Cir. 2020): the 10th Circuit considered a claim of employment discrimination on an intersectional “sex-plus-age” basis. (Modules 9 and 10)
7. *L.W. v. Skrmetti* (6th Cir. 2023): the 6th Circuit rejected 14th Amendment challenges to state laws prohibiting gender-affirming care for transgender youth. (Modules 11 and 12)

## Extra Credit Assignments

### FemPhilAZ

Each year, graduate students here in our philosophy department organize the [Arizona Feminist Philosophy Graduate Conference](https://www.femphilaz.com/) (FemPhilAZ), and many of the talks bear closely on the materials and topics of this class.

You can earn a 10% extra credit on two of your module quizzes by watching any of the FemPhilAZ talks, writing a 1–2 page response paper, and emailing it to me by 11:59pm on Sunday, January 7, 2024. You should spend roughly half of your response paper summarizing the argument presented in the talk and then the other half critically engaging with it (e.g., raise a problem, defend it against a worry, connect it to an idea or argument we discussed in class, apply it to a different context).

Talks that are particularly relevant to our course include Professor Connie Rosati’s 2020 keynote on *Obergefell* (the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case that declared bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional), Professor Gina Schouten’s 2021 keynote on liberal feminism, RJ Krabbendam’s 2021 talk on affective injustice, and Joan O’Bryan’s 2022 paper on Beauvoir, MacKinnon, and Butler. But you should feel free to pick whichever talk you find most interesting!

### Completing Extra Modules

If you decide to complete more than the ten required modules, only the ten highest grades you receive on the reading guides and quizzes will count for purposes of the letter grade requirements. But note that you must submit a completed reading guide in order to take the quiz.

### Completing Extra Case Discussions

Likewise, if you decide to complete more than the two required case discussions, only the two highest grades you receive on the case discussions will count for purposes of the letter grade requirements.
