PHIL 324: Law and Morality\

## The Story of Rex

-   Fuller offers a contemporary version of natural law theory that
    responds in part to Hart's legal positivism.
    -   For legal positivists, a law can fail to satisfy requirements of
        morality and still be valid.
    
        -   For example, on Hart's account, a morally indefensible rule
            can nonetheless be legally valid as long as it is recognized
            as passing all the tests provided by the rule of
            recognition.
    
        -   Indeed, for someone like Hart, this is something to be
            desired: Unjust laws should not be excluded from the subject
            matter of jurisprudence.
    
    -   Natural law theorists, on the other hand, insist that morality
        is a necessary condition on legal validity---an unjust law is no
        law at all.
    
-   In a classic Fuller fashion, Fuller introduces his account by way of
    an allegory. The protagonist, Rex, has just come to the throne. He
    will try to make laws, but will fail miserably in eight ways. These
    eight ways to fail to make law, Fuller argues, represent eight moral
    requirements that any law needs to satisfy in order to be law to
    begin with.

    -   The legal system that Rex inherits is a mess. So, Rex decides to
        repeal all existing laws and start afresh.

    -   Unfortunately, Rex is *very* bad at making generalizations, so
        he decides not to attempt the crafting of a new code. Instead,
        he will personally adjudicate individual cases with the hope
        that at least some generalizable rules will emerge naturally.

        -   But "\[a\]fter he had handed down literally hundreds of
            decisions neither he nor his subjects could detect in those
            decisions any pattern whatsoever."

        -   Fuller claims that Rex has failed to make any law at all.

    -   Second try: Rex figures that he has to write a code even though
        he's *very* bad at it. So, he writes it and announces that he
        will follow it in adjudicating cases from now on. However,
        because he is not that confident about his abilities to write
        generalized provisions, he also announces that he will not make
        the code public.
        -   "To Rex's surprise this sensible plan was deeply resented by
            his subjects. They declared it was very unpleasant to have
            one's case decided by rules when there was no way of knowing
            what those rules were."
        
        -   Again, Fuller claims that Rex has failed to make any law at
            all.
        
    -   Third try: Rex now understands that his subjects demand to know
        what the rules are. Soon, he comes up with a smart solution: He
        will decide cases, and, then, at the end of the year, write and
        publish the rules that explain his decisions using hindsight.
        But, and this is what's so smart about his solution, the rules
        will not be binding on future cases---each year, Rex will repeat
        the process of deciding cases and then capitalizing on hindsight
        to come up with rules that apply retroactively and only
        retroactively to cases already decided.
        -   Rex's subjects are still not satisfied: They demand not just
            to know what the rules are, but to know what the rules are
            *in advance*.
        
        -   Fuller: Rex has failed to make any law at all.
        
    -   Fourth try: Rex gives in and finally publishes a code that
        provides for the rules applicable going forward. A different
        problem, however, emerges: "Legal experts who studied \[Rex's
        code\] declared that there was not a single sentence in it that
        could be understood either by an ordinary citizen or by a
        trained lawyer."
        -   "Indignation became general and soon a picket appeared
            before the royal palace carrying a sign that read, 'How can
            anybody follow a rule that nobody can understand?' "
        
        -   Fuller: Rex has failed to make any law at all.
        
    -   Fifth try: To remedy its obscurity, Rex orders a group of
        experts to edit his code and make it intelligible, without
        altering its substance. "The resulting code was a model of
        clarity, but as it was studied it became apparent that its new
        clarity had merely brought to light that it was honeycombed with
        contradictions. It was reliably reported that there was not a
        single provision in the code that was not nullified by another
        provision inconsistent with it."
        -   "A picket again appeared before the royal residence carrying
            a sign that read, 'This time the king made himself
            clear---in both directions.' "
        
        -   Fuller: Rex has failed to make any law at all.
        
    -   Sixth try: Rex is now getting annoyed. "He instructed his
        experts to purge the code of contradictions, but at the same
        time to stiffen drastically every requirement contained in it
        and to add a long list of new crimes. Thus, where before the
        citizen summoned to the throne was given ten days in which to
        report, in the revision the time was cut to ten seconds. It was
        made a crime, punishable by ten years' imprisonment, to cough,
        sneeze, hiccough, faint or fall down in the presence of the
        king. It was made treason not to understand, believe in, and
        correctly profess the doctrine of evolutionary, democratic
        redemption."
        -   Rex's subjects are furious: "To command what cannot be done
            is not to make law; it is to unmake law, for a command that
            cannot be obeyed serves no end but confusion, fear and
            chaos."
        
        -   Fuller: Rex has failed to make any law at all.
        
    -   Seventh try: Rex has his experts work so hard to overhaul his
        code and they end up producing a perfectly crafted revision.
        However, because of all the chaos his failure has created, Rex
        has to revise the code every day to accommodate new changes in
        his country.
        -   Rex's subjects: "A law that changes every day is worse than
            no law at all."
        
        -   Fuller: Rex has failed to make any law at all.
        
    -   Eighth try: Things eventually calm down and Rex no longer has to
        make daily changes to the code. Indeed, Rex has now gotten
        himself together and started publishing seemingly well-reasoned
        opinions. However, his subjects soon discover that Rex will
        purport to apply the code but in fact his decision has nothing
        to do with what the code says.
    
        -   Fuller: Yet again, Rex has failed to make any law at all.
    
-   So, to summarize, here are the eight ways Rex has failed to make law
    according to Fuller:

    1.  A failure to make *rules*;

    2.  A failure of *promulgation*;

    3.  An abuse of *retroactive law-making*;

    4.  A failure of *intelligibility*;

    5.  A failure of *logical consistency*;

    6.  A failure of *followability*;

    7.  A failure of *relative stability over time*; and

    8.  A failure of *congruence between laws as announced and as
        administered*.

## Fuller's Internal Morality of Law

-   According to Fuller, "A total failure in any one of these eight
    directions does not simply result in a bad system of law; it results
    in something that is not properly called a legal system at all."

    -   For example, a rule that is logically inconsistent, on Fuller's
        account, is not legally valid even if it is recognized as
        passing all the tests provided by Hart's rule of recognition.

-   The eight ways to fail to make laws, Fuller argues, represent eight
    aspects of the law's *internal morality*, that is, valid laws:

    1.  Must be rules;

    2.  Must be promulgated;

    3.  Must not be enacted in a way that abuses retroactive law-making;

    4.  Must be intelligible;

    5.  Must be logically consistent;

    6.  Must be possible to obey;

    7.  Must not be changed so frequently that they end up failing to
        provide action guidance; and

    8.  Must be administered in a way that's congruent with the laws as
        announced.

-   In what sense is the internal morality of law *moral*?

    -   Fuller finds it helpful to distinguish *procedural* natural law
        theory and *substantive* natural law theory.

        -   Substantive natural law theory requires valid laws to
            satisfy certain *substantive* demands of morality.

            -   These substantive moral requirements are substantive in
                the sense that they impose limitations on the *content*
                of valid laws---there are certain things that valid laws
                can or cannot say.

            -   For example, a substantive natural law theorist might
                claim a law that permits abortion is not legally valid
                because abortion is morally impermissible. This is a
                substantive moral requirement because it claims no law
                can be legally valid as long as it permits abortion,
                regardless of whether or not it is recognized as passing
                all the tests provided by this society's rule of
                recognition.

        -   Procedural natural law theory, on the other hand, restricts
            not the content but the *form* of valid laws,[^1] like
            whether they are intelligible (regardless of what they
            actually say), whether they are logically consistent (again,
            regardless of what they actually say), etc.

    -   Fuller's internal morality is moral in the procedural rather
        than the substantive sense.

## Objections to Fuller's Internal Morality of Law

-   Objection 1: Fuller's account undermines the initial appeal of
    natural law theory.

    -   It's worth noting that Fuller's internal morality of law is very
        *lenient*: There can be very unjust laws (in a substantive
        sense) that nevertheless satisfy the eight procedural
        requirements.

        -   Think about, for example, China's one-child (now
            three-child) policy:

            1.  It is a rule;

            2.  It is promulgated;

            3.  It is not retroactive;

            4.  It is intelligible;

            5.  It is logically consistent;

            6.  It is possible to obey;

            7.  It is not changed so frequently as to fail to provide
                action guidance;

            8.  It is (for the most part?) administered in a way that's
                congruent with the rule as announced.

    -   It seems Fuller's internal morality of law is natural law theory
        with no teeth.

-   Objection 2: Fuller's account is perfectly compatible with legal
    positivism?
    -   Fuller's eight procedural requirements seem to be moral
        requirements only because Fuller is gerrymandering the meaning
        of "morality."
    
        -   Of course, Fuller can use the word "morality" however he
            likes, but then he and legal positivists might just be
            talking past each other: When legal positivists, for
            example, deny legal validity is grounded in part in moral
            facts, what they mean is *substantive* moral facts, not
            procedural moral facts. If so, then Fuller might in fact
            agree with legal positivists.
    
    -   Indeed, Fuller's account seems to satisfy both the Social Thesis
        and the Conceptual Separability Thesis, as long as we understand
        legal positivists' "morality" to be "substantive morality":
    
        -   Fuller himself admits that his eight procedural requirements
            are not substantive moral requirements. His account then
            satisfies the Social Thesis: A law is legally valid not in
            virtue of any (substantive) moral facts.
    
        -   Likewise, it satisfies the Conceptual Separability Thesis:
            As a conceptual matter, (substantive) morality is not a
            necessary condition on legal validity.
    
    -   At best, then, Fuller's internal/procedural morality is
        compatible with legal positivism. At worst, it is a closeted
        legal positivist theory.

[^1]: Fuller thinks procedural moral requirements can have substantive implications despite being procedural. However, we are not going to dive into that for our purposes.
