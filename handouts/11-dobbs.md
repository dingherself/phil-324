# Supplemental Notes on *Dobbs*

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

Since I recorded the lectures for this course in the Summer of 2021, there have been two major developments in the Court’s abortion jurisprudence. The first concerned sovereign immunity issues in Texas’s S.B. 8, which we covered in our very first module. The second, of course, is the Court’s decision to overrule *Roe* and *Casey* in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization* (2022).

For our purposes, we will focus on the *Dobbs* Court’s substantive due process analaysis. Recall from the readings and lectures of this module that *Roe*, as interpreted by *Casey*, found the right to abortion not in the Equal Protection Clause, but in the Due Process Clause. This means the Court conceptualized abortion largely as an issue of privacy/autonomy, rather than gender equality.

As we discussed this week, the Court has adopted a similiar tier-of-scrutiny framework in reviewing statutes under the Due Process Clause. While a mere *liberty interest* receives only rational basis review, a *fundamental right* gets strict scurtiny. There is, then, a very non-trivial question about when a given liberty interest amounts to a fundamental right, when the Constitution does not explicitly mention that right (a right like this is called an *implied*, as opposed to enumerated, fundamental right).

One way to think about the approach the Court took in the *Griswold*-*Roe*-*Casey* line of cases is that it was largely a *conceptual* analysis. The *Roe* Court did this, for example, when it held:

> This right of privacy . . . is *broad enough* to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. 410 U.S. at 153.

In other words, the inquiry boils down to whether the right to privacy, properly understood, *includes* or *implies* a right to decide to terminate one’s pregnancy. To the Court, the answer was easy: abortion bans represent a governmental intrusion into a private medical decision, and this directly infringes on the right to privacy.

In a much later case, *Washington v. Glucksberg* (1997), however, the Court announced its modern test for implied fundamental rights under the Due Process Clause: to qualify as a fundamental right, the unenumerated liberty interest must be

1) “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition [sometimes the Court also uses the plural ‘traditions’—think about why this might be significant]”; and
2) “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.” 521 U.S. at 720-21 (cleaned up).

The *Glucksberg* test raises a tricky question: how should we think about fundamental rights that the Court had already recognized prior to announcing the *Glucksberg* test? In *Dobbs*, a majority decided to apply the *Glucksberg* test ***retroactively*** to *Roe* and *Casey*, and found that the right to abortion is not “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and thus not a fundamental right under *Glucksberg*.

As actual historians immediately pointed out, this is not obvious. The *Dobbs* Court’s analysis focused on English common law that predated the founding of the United States, as well as history at the time of the 14th Amendment’s ratification in 1868. We have encountered most of these historical facts: abortion was a common law crime only after *quickening* (roughly 16–18 weeks of pregnancy), and states did not start to outlaw until the mid-19th century (by the early-2oth century, all states prohibited abortion).

One immediate problem is that the law that the *Dobbs* Court upheld bans abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, which, well, is prior to quickening and would be permitted at common law. Another problem is the significance that the Court placed on what states were doing at the time of the 14th Amendment’s ratification: it’s not obvious why should we defer to what most states were doing in 1868, when ratifying the 14th Amendment was meant to (radically, nonetheless) *change* what was permissible legislation? By the same logic, it would seem that the right to interracial marriage, for example, is also not “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and thus not an implied fundamental right.

The majority wanted to assure us that its analysis does not generalize to racial cases (or perhaps even to LGBTQ+ rights), because abortion is “fundamentally different”:

> What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which *Roe* and *Casey* rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call “potential life” and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an “unborn human being.” *Dobbs*, 142 S. Ct. at 2258.

By contrast, the Court wrote, “The exercise of the rights at issue in *Griswold* [contraceptive access by married couples], *Eisenstadt* [contraceptive access by unmarried persons], *Lawrence* [sex between same-sex persons], and *Obergefell* [marriage between same-sex persons] does not destroy a ‘potential life,’ but an abortion has that effect.” *Id.* at 2261.

The dissent was not convinced: the Court’s attempt to distinguish abortion from these other rights seem entirely *ad hoc*. Where does the Constitution say, for example, “destroying a potential life” is a relevant constitutional distinction? Also, one can certainly believe that contraceptives (and by a slight stretch of the imagination, perhaps even same-sex intimacy and marriage) destroy potential life. The Court had no answer as to why the Constitution must draw the line here, or how that line can even be drawn.

Justice Kavanaugh suggested that the relevant consideration is neutrality: “Because the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion, this Court also must be scrupulously neutral.” *Id.* at 2305 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). In other words, if the Constitution does not say anything explicit about abortion, then states should be allowed to decide.

As the dissent pointed out, this seems strenuous a response at best:

> [E]liminating [the abortion] right . . . is not taking a “neutral” position, as Justice Kavanaugh tries to argue. . . . [W]ould he say that the Court is being “scrupulously neutral” if it allowed New York and California to ban all the guns they want?” . . . If the Court told the States: Decide for yourselves whether to put restrictions on church attendance? We could go on—and in fact we will. Suppose Justice Kavanaugh were to say (in line with the majority opinion) that the rights we just listed are more textually or historically grounded than the right to choose. What, then, of the right to contraception or same-sex marriage? Would it be “scrupulously neutral” for the Court to eliminate those rights too? The point of all these examples is that when it comes to rights, the Court does not act “neutrally” when it leaves everything up to the States. Rather, the Court acts neutrally when it protects the right against all comers. *Id.* at 2328 (Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., dissenting).

And that means: “When the Court decimates a right women have held for 50 years, the Court is not being ‘scrupulously neutral.’ It is instead taking sides: against women who wish to exercise the right, and for States (like Mississippi) that want to bar them from doing so.” *Id.* And they succeeded.
