# Supplemental Note on the Sovereign Immunity Doctrine

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

What is a court in fact doing when it declares a law unconstitutional? Does it literally open some official edition of statutes and rip some pages off, so to speak? This is a rarely discussed procedural aspect of the law, but it figured prominently in the year leading up to the Supreme Court’s decision to overrule *Roe v. Wade* (1973)—the abortion rights landmark that we will discuss later on in this course.

How? Why? What? To talk about these connections, we need to understand the idea of 11th Amendment immunity. Recall that the 11th Amendment provides,

> The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.

While the text of the 11th Amendment says only that you can’t sue, say, the Arizona government in federal court if you are not a citizen of Arizona, the Supreme Court, in a case called *Hans v. Louisiana* (1890), interpreted the 11th Amendment to embody a general doctrine of *sovereign immunity*. 

The idea of sovereign immunity originates from English common law: “The King can do no wrong.” Just as a king can’t be sued in the king’s court because the king’s court derives its authority from the king himself, the Supreme Court has interpreted the 11th Amendment to imply that the state (the federal government or any state government) likewise can’t be sued in its own court. This interpretation bars, for example, the Arizona government from being sued in federal court not just by citizens of California or citizens of Canada, but even by its own citizens—unless the state consents to being sued. (Does this make the Arizona government the King?)

As you can imagine, this creates problems: for example, you want to be able to sue the state (either the federal government or your state government) if the state violates your rights. In *Ex parte Young* (1908), the Court carved out an exception for sovereign immunity: state officials acting on behalf of the state (i.e., in their official capacity)—but not the state itself—can be sued in federal court. The idea is again from English common law: while the King himself can do no wrong, the King’s servants can. In the American context, the King’s servants become state officials acting in their official capacity, enforcing laws. And when a court “strikes down” a law, what it does is it will enter an order enjoining the relevant state officials from enforcing the law; the court does not literally remove the law from the books.

Over the years, the *Ex parte Young* fiction has made a vast number of constitutional challenges possible. We will discuss *Roe v. Wade* later, but now you can understand why it was Henry Wade—the district attorney for Dallas County—who got sued: he was sued on behalf of the state of Texas because the Texas government itself could not be sued. Similarly, Thomas E. Dobbs, who led the Mississippi State Department of Health, was sued on behalf of the state in the lawsuit that became *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization* (it started out as *Jackson Women’s Health Organization v. Dobbs*, but because Mississippi lost in the lower courts, it became the petitioner when it asked the Supreme Court for certiorari).

(There is an important caveat: the state can sue you (you don’t have sovereign immunity). In these cases, if you lose and you appeal, you might get case names like *Loving v. Virginia*, *Griswold v. Connecticut, Hoyt v. Florida*, and so on—cases that we will discuss in this course.)

Now, abortion becomes salient here because Texas discovered a loophole when it tried to ban abortion in the year leading up to *Dobbs*: notice that under the sovereign immunity doctrine, you can’t directly sue the state in order to challenge an unconstitutional statute; you have to find the state official(s) responsible for enforcing the law and sue them as agents acting on behalf of the state. So, Texas thought, *what if we enact an unconstitutional abortion ban but put no state officials in charge of enforcing it such that we can’t be sued*?

Thus, Texas’s notorious S.B. 8 was born. The law, which was passed in May 2021, has two main provisions:

- *6-week abortion ban*: the law prohibits all abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected (or if the physician fails to perform a test), with medical emergency as the only exception.
- *Private enforcement scheme*: the law creates a private right of action, allowing *any private individual* to sue in Texas state court anyone who performs an abortion (or “aids or abets” it) in violation of the ban; and, if successful (which the law takes steps to make easy), they can cover at least $10,000 in statutory damages for *each* abortion performed in violation of S.B. 8. (But in case the abortion provider wins, the law prohibits the recovery of legal costs from the plaintiff, even if the lawsuit is frivolous.)

The idea, again, is that because the law is enforced by private individuals, no state officials can be sued in federal court as proxies for the Texas government via the *Ex parte Young* exception. And the Texas government itself can’t be sued because it has sovereign immunity.

S.B. 8 was scheduled to go into effect on September 1, 2021. On July 13, a group of abortion providers went to federal court and sued every potential defendant they could think of:

- A Texas state court judge, Austin Jackson (as the representative of the class of all Texas state court judges) and a Texas state court clerk, Penny Clarkston (as the representative of the class of all Texas state court clerks)—the abortion providers argued that federal court can and should enjoin them from docketing lawsuits under S.B. 8.
- Officials on various Texas state medical licensing boards, on the theory that they had authority to impose sanctions for unlawful medical practices.
- The Texas Attorney General, whose office had the authority to sue medical professionals for violation of state health codes.
- Mark Lee Dickson, a private individual working for Right to Life East Texas, who threatened to sue abortion providers under S.B. 8.

This became *Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson*. The defendants quickly moved to dismiss the case on 11th Amendment grounds (yes, including Mr. Dickson, who was a private individual and so clearly didn’t have sovereign immunity).

As we mentioned in our discussion of the shadow docket, these pre-enforcement challenges move on very fast schedules, and there were a lot of shadow docket actions in this case. I’ll recount this history here to illustrate how the shadow docket can work in practice.

- After the district court denied the motion to dismiss on Wednesday, August 25 and scheduled a hearing for Monday, August 30 to decide whether it would preliminarily enjoin S.B. 8’s enforcement just prior to it going into effect on September 1, all defendants, again including Mr. Dickson, appealed to the Fifth Circuit. The district court then paused the scheduled hearing except as to Mr. Dickson (once again, he’s not a state official; he clearly has no plausible claim to sovereign immunity).
- On Friday, August 27, however, the Fifth Circuit, with no explanation, administratively stayed all district court proceedings, including the Dickson hearing. (The Fifth Circuit would not act again until September 10, ten days after the law went into effect, when it declined to enjoin the law.)

- With no Fifth Circuit action, on Monday, August 30 (two days before the law was set to go into effect), the providers asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief. The Court did not act until 11:58 p.m. (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, September 1, almost a full day *after* S.B. 8 became law. In a one-paragraph, unsigned, barely reasoned order, the Court refused to grant relief, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the dissent.


Then, the federal government, not bound by sovereign immunity, stepped in and sued Texas separately (this became *United States v. Texas*). In the federal government’s case, the district court entered a preliminary injunction against Texas on October 6, but the Fifth Circuit stayed it on October 14. The federal government then turned to the Supreme Court for emergency relief.

On October 22, the Court did something very unusual: it took up both the abortion providers’ and the federal government’s cases and scheduled oral argument, which took place on November 1. But opinions were not handed down until December 10.

The Court held that the abortion providers could not sue state court judges, or state court clerks, or the Texas Attorney General, or even Mr. Dickson (on the grounds that Mr. Dickson then promised he wouldn’t sue). But they could sue, the Court explained, officials on the state licensing boards, who, as the Court interpreted Texas law, have disciplinary authority over violations of S.B. 8. The Court then decided to DIG the federal government’s case.

But this was still not the end of it. Over the abortion providers’ objection, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Fifth Circuit, which, instead of remanding back to the district court, certified on January 17, 2022, a question of state law to the Texas Supreme Court, a question that the U.S. Supreme Court seemed to have already decided: whether the Texas state licensing officials have enforcement authority under S.B. 8.

On the shadow docket, the U.S. Supreme Court, divided 6–3, refused to intervene. Then, on March 11, 2022, the Texas Supreme Court held that the state licensing officials actually don’t have enforcement authority under S.B. 8 (never mind what the U.S. Supreme Court had said), and so they can’t be sued after all!
