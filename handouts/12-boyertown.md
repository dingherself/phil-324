# *Doe v. Boyertown Area School District* (3d Cir. 2018)

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## Background

-   In this module, what we will discuss is a 2018 Pennsylvania case,
    *Doe v. Boyertown Area School District*.

-   On May 13, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights
    Division and the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil
    Rights issued guidance on protections for transgender students under
    Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, in the form of a "Dear
    Colleague" letter.

    -   Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs
        and activities that receive federal funding.

    -   In the Dear Colleague Letter, the two Departments stated that it
        is their view that discrimination on the basis of gender
        identity falls under Title IX's protections against
        discrimination on the basis of sex.

    -   Specifically with respect to restrooms and locker rooms, the two
        Departments provided the following guidance: "A school may
        provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow
        transgender students access to such facilities consistent with
        their gender identity. A school may not require transgender
        students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender
        identity or to use individual-user facilities when other
        students are not required to do so. A school may, however, make
        individual-user options available to all students who
        voluntarily seek additional privacy."

-   The Boyertown Area School District, which received federal funding,
    decided to permit transgender students to use restrooms and locker
    rooms that align with their gender identity, but only on a
    *case-by-case*, *student-specific* basis:

    -   To obtain permission, a transgender student would meet with a
        school counselor. The counselor would discuss the request with
        the grade-level assistant principal. The two would then discuss
        it with the school principal. The school principal would finally
        discuss it with the administrators of the School District.

    -   Upon approval, transgender students will be allowed to use
        *only* restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender
        identity. That is, an approved trans girl is allowed to use
        *only* girls' restrooms and locker rooms, and an approved trans
        boy is allowed to use *only* boys' restrooms and locker rooms.

    -   Among the 1659 students enrolled at the Boyertown Area Senior
        High School (BASH)---the high school involved in the
        lawsuit---during the 2016--17 school year, permission was
        granted to a total of 6 students.

        -   The high school had multi-user restrooms with single-user
            stalls and 4 to 8 single-user restrooms available to all
            students depending on the time of day.

        -   The locker rooms at the high school had common areas,
            private "team rooms" and single-user showers with privacy
            curtains. Students not comfortable changing in the locker
            room could change privately in the private shower stalls,
            team rooms or single-user restrooms.

-   In March 2017, a cisgender student (a minor under the pseudonym
    "Joel Doe"), represented by Alliance Defending Freedom and the
    Independence Law Center, filed a lawsuit challenging the legality
    and constitutionality of the school district's trans-inclusive
    bathroom and locker room access policy.
    -   A local Pennsylvania youth-led LGBTQ organization, Pennsylvania
        Youth Congress, represented by the ACLU, joined the litigation
        as an intervenor-defendant on behalf of transgender students
        affected.
    
    -   Three other cisgender students also joined the lawsuit as
        plaintiffs.
    
    -   The plaintiffs asked for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the
        school district from implementing the policy.
    
-   After a three-day hearing, the district court denied preliminary
    injunction in August 2017.
    -   The plaintiffs appealed, and the district court proceedings were
        suspended pending appeal.
    
-   On May 24, 2018, a Third Circuit panel heard oral argument.

    -   The three judges took less than 30 minutes to confer, and
        announced from the bench their unanimous decision to affirm the
        denial of preliminary injunction.

    -   Formal opinion followed in June, but was revised in July (more
        on this later).

-   In November 2018, the plaintiffs filed a cert petition, asking the
    U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.

    -   This time is important to keep in mind: The cert petition
        largely coincided with the cert petitions of the Title VII cases
        that we discussed a few modules ago. The U.S. Supreme Court
        ultimately decided to take only the Title VII cases, and
        summarily denied the cert petition in *Boyertown* on May 28,
        2019, with no public dissents from any of the justices.

-   Still, after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, the
    plaintiffs requested that the District Court proceedings be
    suspended until the U.S. Supreme Court's resolution of the Title VII
    cases (which were not expected until a year later, the summer of
    2020).

    -   But, in September 2019, two and a half years after the case
        began, the plaintiffs voluntarily dropped the case, letting the
        school district's policy stand.

## The Opinion

-   The case presents three questions: whether the school district's
    trans-inclusive bathroom and locker room access policy
    -   Violates the cisgender students' constitutional right to bodily
        privacy.
    
    -   Discriminates against the cisgender students "on the basis of
        sex" under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
    
    -   Constitutes invasion of privacy (a tort) under Pennsylvania
        common law.
    
-   Note that all of these questions are about whether the policy is
    *permissible*, not whether it's obligatory.

    -   That is, whether the school district is *allowed* to have a
        trans-inclusive bathroom and locker room access policy, not
        whether it must have such a policy.

-   We will focus on the constitutional question here: the cisgender
    students argue that the *mere presence* of transgender students in
    sex-segregated restrooms and locker rooms, no matter what the
    transgender students see, is in and of itself a violation of the
    cisgender students' constitutionally protected right to privacy.

    -   The Third Circuit panel finds this argument absurd: "We reject
        the premise of this argument because BASH's policy does not
        force any cisgender student to disrobe in the presence of any
        student---cisgender or transgender. BASH has provided facilities
        for any student who does not feel comfortable being in the
        confines of a communal restroom or locker room. BASH has
        installed privacy stalls and set some bathrooms aside as
        single-user facilities so that any student who is uneasy
        undressing or using a restroom in the presence of others can
        take steps to avoid contact. BASH's policy does not compel a
        privacy violation for any student.

    -   "In any event, we decline to recognize such an expansive
        constitutional right to privacy---a right that would be violated
        by the presence of students who do not share the same birth sex.
        Moreover, no court has ever done so. As counsel for the School
        District noted during oral argument, the appellants are claiming
        a very broad right of personal privacy in a space that is, by
        definition and common usage, just not that private. School
        locker rooms and restrooms are spaces where it is not only
        common to encounter others in various stages of undress, it is
        expected. The facilities exist so that students can attend to
        their personal biological and hygienic needs and change their
        clothing. As the Supreme Court has stated, '\[p\]ublic school
        locker rooms . . . are not notable for the privacy they
        afford.'â€†"

-   But the panel entertains a weaker argument: that the *exposure* of
    cisgender students' partially clothed bodies to transgender students
    constitutes a violation of the cisgender students' constitutional
    right to privacy.

    -   The panel subjects the school district's policy to strict
        scrutiny: it must be narrowly tailed to serve a compelling state
        interest.
        -   It's not entirely clear that the panel thinks strict
            scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review. The panel
            seems to think if the policy can pass strict scrutiny, then
            it can surely pass more relaxed standards of review.
        
    -   The panel finds a compelling state interest in the protection of
        transgender students from discrimination.
    
        -   The panel notes that transgender individuals are already at
            disproportionate risks of "anxiety and depression, low
            self-esteem, engaging in self-injurious behaviors, suicide,
            substance use, homelessness, and eating disorders among
            other adverse outcomes."
    
        -   It cites a 2015 national survey (with 27,715 respondents)
            conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality:
            40% attempted suicide in their lifetime (c.f. general US
            population: 4.6%); 39% experienced serious distress in the
            previous month (c.f. general US population: 5%).
    
        -   The panel also suggests that adopting a trans-inclusive
            restroom and locker room access policy not only helps
            protect transgender students from discrimination, but also
            "benefits all students by promoting acceptance."
    
    -   The next step in a strict scrutiny analysis is narrow tailoring.
    
        -   The plaintiffs argue that the policy is not narrowly tailed
            because there is a more narrowly tailored option to serve
            the compelling state interest: transgender students should
            be allowed to use *only* single-user facilities.
    
        -   The panel rejects this option, stating, very strongly,
    
            -   "Not only would forcing transgender students to use
                single-user facilities or those that correspond to their
                birth sex not serve the compelling interest that the
                School District has identified here, it would
                significantly undermine it. . . . Adopting the
                appellants' position would very publicly brand all
                transgender students with a scarlet 'T,' and they should
                not have to endure that as the price of attending their
                public school."
    
        -   The panel thinks that the School District's policy is
            narrowly tailored: The facilities provides privacy
            protections such as stalls and curtains. And there are
            alternative single-user facilities that cisgender students
            could elect to use.
    
        -   The panel concludes that the policy survives strict
            scrutiny.

## Critiques

-   The Harvard Law Review case note raises two worries about the
    strict scrutiny analysis:
    -   *Tailored too narrowly*: Recall that the school district's
        policy requires that a transgender student obtain approval
        before they may use restrooms and locker rooms that align with
        their gender identity. The HLR case note argues that
        this preapproval requirement is not only unnecessary but harmful
        to transgender students.
        -   First, privacy-protecting stalls and curtains should already
            be sufficient for protecting students' constitutional right
            to privacy.
        
        -   Second, the preapproval process rests on a fantastical
            basis: As the note points out, "\[The
            School District\] concedes that it is unable 'to determine
            whether a student is gender nonconforming or gender
            dysphoric, and \[school administrators\] cannot determine a
            student's gender identity.'â€†" And the school district is
            right: there is no way it can determine whether a student is
            "really" transgender.
        
        -   Third, the school district *should* be in no position to
            make such a determination. The note argues
            that the preapproval requirement, rather than protects
            transgender students from discrimination, in fact
            *undermines* their autonomy.
            -   One, it subjects transgender students to heightened
                scrutiny compared to cisgender students.
            
            -   Two, it forces transgender students to conform to school
                administrators' conceptions of what a "real" girl or boy
                is like.
            
            -   Three, school administrators should not be allowed to
                act as judges or gatekeepers of students' genders.
            
        -   This last point is stressed especially well by the Lester
            chapters. The policing and gatekeeping of transgender and
            gender non-conforming people's genders and bodies is one of
            the most salient expressions and enforcement mechanisms of
            their structural and systematic subordination.
        
            -   The function of the preapproval requirement is to
                provide an *appearance* of safety and control, an
                appearance specifically to assure cisgender students and
                parents. In the experiences of transgender students,
                however, the preapproval requirement singles them out
                and gatekeeps their access to school facilities, and, by
                extension, to school life. The problem is especially
                profound in the case of bathrooms. Transgender students
                will have to use bathrooms, like everybody else, and
                gatekeeping their access to school bathrooms means they
                will have to find ways around it---like controlling
                water intake, like avoiding going to the bathroom unless
                absolutely necessary, like the "trans bladder syndrome."
        
    -   *Scrutinized too strictly*: The note also
        argues that strict scrutiny is inappropriate.
        -   As the Third Circuit panel itself recognizes, "The
            touchstone of constitutional privacy protection is whether
            the information at issue is within an individual's
            *reasonable* expectations of confidentiality." (emphasis
            added, internal quotations omitted)
        
        -   It also recognizes that locker rooms and restrooms are, "by
            definition and common usage, just not that private."
        
        -   If so, then, it's unclear at best how even the *exposure* of
            partially clothed body parts in restrooms and locker rooms
            infringes on cisgender students' constitutional right to
            privacy.
    
-   A further question is whether trans-inclusive bathroom and locker
    room access policies are not just *permitted* but *required* by
    Title IX (and perhaps the Constitution).

    -   In its initial opinion, the Third Circuit panel reached an
        affirmative answer using a sex stereotyping theory. But they
        ultimately decided to revise the opinion and retract that part
        because the case at hand does not call for it.

    -   We didn't really introduce the sex stereotyping theory of sex
        discrimination in this class, but we have a few other
        theoretical frameworks at our disposal:

        -   First, courts usually look to Title VII precedents in
            interpreting Title VII. Following *Bostock*, then, we can
            consider the question using the but-for test: If a trans
            student were assigned a different sex at birth, they would
            be allowed to access the restroom or locker room that aligns
            with their gender identity. So, it seems that Title IX will
            prohibit discrimination against trans students as
            discrimination on the basis of sex. A few courts have
            reached this conclusion.

            -   A complication, though, is the Boyertown-style policy
                that requires transgender students to use *only* the
                restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender
                identity. But there are transgender students who are
                gender fluid, bigender, nonbinary, etc. At best, the
                Boyertown-style policy would treat them as binary
                transgender students. At worst, they would not be
                recognized as transgender students at all (what's
                especially worrying is things like gender fluidity could
                be used as evidence *against* the student's
                "transness").

        -   Second, we should consider the dominance approach. The
            question for the dominance approach is whether denying
            transgender students access to sex-segregated school
            facilities would contribute to their social disadvantage and
            social subordination. It seems the answer is yes, especially
            given the importance of access to school facilities as a
            gate to meaningful participation in school life. A
            trans-inclusive school facilities access policy is a means
            to put transgender students on an equal footing with their
            cisgender classmates for the first time.
