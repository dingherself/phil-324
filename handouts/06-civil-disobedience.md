# Civil Disobedience

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## Our Questions

1.  *Delineation*: What counts as civil disobedience?

    -   What distinguishes civil disobedience from *ordinary legal
        demonstrations*?

    -   What distinguishes civil disobedience from other forms of
        *unlawful acts or acts of resistance*?

        -   Ordinary unlawful acts (theft, murder, etc).

        -   Militant revolution or resistance.

        -   Test cases that aim to challenge the validity of a law in
            court.

        -   Conscientious evasion or refusal (e.g., soldier disobeying
            lawful order on grounds of conscience or white Northerners
            violating the Fugitive Slave Act).

2.  *Justification*: Under what circumstances is civil disobedience
    justified?

    -   Note here that the justification (if any) for civil disobedience
        is distinctively *moral* justification.

3.  *Practical considerations*: When is civil disobedience effective or
    prudent?
    -   We will set this question aside for our purposes.

## Defining Civil Disobedience

-   Rawls argues that civil disobedience can take place "only within a
    more or less just democratic state for those citizens who recognize
    and accept the legitimacy of the constitution."

    -   For Rawls, civil disobedience presupposes a moral duty to obey
        democratically enacted laws under a legitimate constitution.

        -   This is a *moral* duty, not a legal one.

        -   Obeying the law need not imply believing the law is just;
            rather, it is a showing of respect for the political process
            of a legitimate liberal constitutional democracy.

        -   The moral duty is a *pro tanto* one: it provides *a* moral
            reason to obey the law even if one believes it is unjust,
            but not a conclusive one.

    -   Accordingly, what is implicated by civil disobedience, Rawls
        thinks, is a conflict of two moral duties:

        -   One the one hand, we have a moral duty to obey
            democratically enacted laws under a legitimate constitution.

        -   But on the other hand, we also have a moral duty to oppose
            injustice.

        -   The question is which is more weighty in a particular case.

    -   Again, this is in part why Rawls thinks it's important to
        distinguish civil disobedience from, say, militant revolution or
        resistance.

        -   On Rawls' conception, civil disobedience always presupposes
            a legitimate liberal constitutional democracy, whereas
            militant revolution or resistance need not.

-   According to Rawls, civil disobedience is "a public, nonviolent,
    conscientious yet political act contrary to law usually done with
    the aim of bringing about a change in the law or policies of the
    government."

    -   Five features of civil disobedience:

        1.  Civil disobedience is *public*.

            -   Rawls thinks civil disobedience is public in two ways:

                -   It invokes *public principles of justice*, not just
                    personal principles of morality.

                -   It takes place *publicly* not privately.

            -   Why does civil disobedience characteristically invoke a
                *public* conception of justice?

                -   Recall that, for Rawls, civil disobedience involves
                    the balancing of the moral duty to obey the law and
                    the moral duty to oppose injustice.

                -   Here, Rawls assumes that civil disobedience is a
                    response to "persistent and deliberate violation of
                    the basic principles of this \[public\] conception
                    \[of justice\] over any extended period of time,
                    especially the infringement of the fundamental equal
                    liberties." And "\[b\]y engaging in civil
                    disobedience a minority forces the majority to
                    consider whether it wishes to have its actions
                    construed in this way, or whether, in view of the
                    common sense of justice, it wishes to acknowledge
                    the legitimate claims of the minority."

            -   Why does civil disobedience characteristically take
                place *publicly*?

                -   For Rawls, civil disobedience is a form of *public
                    speech* that is addressed to the public principles
                    of justice and "the public's sense of justice."

                -   It gives voice to one's "profound and conscientious
                    political convictions."

        2.  Civil disobedience is *nonviolent*.

            -   Rawls' reasons:

                -   Violence is incompatible with civil disobedience as
                    a mode of public address.

                -   Nonviolence expresses one's "fidelity to law."

            -   King's reason:

                -   "\[T\]he means we use must be as pure as the ends we
                    seek."

            -   The Supreme Court's reason in *Walker v. City of
                Birmingham*:

                -   "When protest takes the form of mass demonstrations,
                    parades, or picketing on public streets and
                    sidewalks, the free passage of traffic and the
                    prevention of public disorder and violence become
                    important objects of legitimate state concern."

        3.  Civil disobedience is *conscientious* yet *political*.

            -   For Rawls, civil disobedience is political in two ways:

                -   As a form of public speech, it speaks to the
                    *political* majority's sense of justice.

                -   It is "guided and justified by *political*
                    principles . . . of justice" (my emphasis), not
                    religious principles (c.f. King?).

            -   That is, civil disobedience must be grounded in
                politically conscientious and deeply held convictions
                that the political principles of justice have been
                violated.

        4.  Civil disobedience is *(thought to be) contrary to the law*.

            -   "Thought to be contrary to the law" means the civilly
                disobedient act may or may not *actually* be contrary to
                the law. For example, a court might rule against the
                government and find the law invalid, thereby making the
                civilly disobedient act not actually be contrary to the
                law.

        5.  Civil disobedience is *usually aimed at changing the law or
            governmental policies*.

            -   This in part distinguishes civil disobedience from
                ordinary unlawful acts (e.g., theft) and from
                conscientious evasion or refusal (e.g., a soldier
                refusing to obey an order on grounds of conscience).

    -   Rawls' clarification: Civil disobedience can be direct or
        indirect.
        -   The law thought to be violated by an act of civil
            disobedience need not be the same law that the act of civil
            disobedience aims to protest.
        
        -   *Direct civil disobedience* protests the same law it is
            thought to violate.
        
            -   Example: violating racial segregation laws (e.g., Rosa
                Parks).
        
        -   *Indirect civil disobedience* protests a different law than
            it is thought to violate.
        
            -   Example: public employees participating in strikes not
                to protest laws that forbid public employees from
                striking but to protest other laws.
    
-   Objections to Rawls' definition of civil disobedience

    -   Must civil disobedience be *public*?

        -   Rawls thinks civil disobedience "is engaged in openly with
            fair notice; it is not covert or secretive."

            -   But advance notice may undermine the expressive function
                of civil disobedience on Rawls' conception.

            -   Think about *Walker*: King and his fellow demonstrators
                went to the city government to get a permit, which gave
                the city knowledge of the demonstration. The city then
                went to court and obtained an injunction *ex parte*
                (that is, without notice to the protestors). The
                demonstrators went ahead anyway and were subsequently
                arrested and convicted under the a facially
                unconstitutional city ordinance. Simply because of the
                *ex parte* injunction, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
                convictions, refusing to even entertain the
                unconstitutionality of the city ordinance that underlay
                the convictions.

        -   Another worry is the civilly disobedient *act* itself and
            its *expression* could be separable.
            -   For example, can the *act* of civil disobedience take
                place in private and then be *publicized* later? Or,
                should we say it is the *publication* that is the
                civilly disobedient act (it seems to violate no law)?
        
    -   Must civil disobedience be *nonviolent*?

        -   Rawls' first reason: Violence is incompatible with civil
            disobedience as a mode of public address.
            -   Rawls writes: "\[Civil disobedience\] tries to avoid the
                use of violence, especially against persons, not from
                the abhorrence of the use of force in principle, but
                because it is a final expression of one's case. . . .
                Indeed, any interference with the civil liberties of
                others tends to obscure the civilly disobedient quality
                of one's act."

            -   This treatment seems too simplistic. Consider King's
                distinction between *negative peace* and *positive
                peace*. For King, negative peace is "the absence of
                tension," whereas positive peace "presence of justice."
                But in the transition from negative peace to positive
                peace, it may be necessary to "bring to the surface the
                hidden tension that is already alive." Here, the
                protestors are "not the creators of tension," but they
                "bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and
                dealt with." And there is a danger, King warns, if we
                fail to recognize "law and order exist for the purpose
                of establishing justice." None of this is obviously
                incompatible with civil disobedience as a mode of public
                address.
    
        -   Rawls' second reason: Nonviolence expresses one's fidelity
            to law.
            -   But how does nonviolence expresses one's fidelity to
            law? You might think, it does so by minimizing the bad
            consequences of breaking the law.

            -   But this tracks the wrong distinction. Compare a
            *nonviolent* strike of hospital workers, which may
            result in really bad consequences, and a *violent* act
            of civil disobedience which results in damage to windows
            but no deaths or injuries. The violence/nonviolence
            distinction is just not what's doing the work here.

        -   King's reason: Violence is morally wrong, and we can’t use it
        to achieve justice.

            -   On what grounds might someone think violence is morally
            wrong? One answer is violence is *intrinsically* morally
            wrong, regardless of the consequences of violence. But
            this seems questionable. For example, is burning a flag
            wrong (an act of violence to an object) *in and of
            itself*?
        
            -   Or, you might think violence is *instrumentally* morally
            wrong based on the consequences it produces. But this
            allows the possibility that, *all things considered*, an
            act of violence can produce (overall or net) good
            consequences (when the bad consequences are outweighed
            by the good consequences).
        
            -   Or, you might think violence is morally wrong because it
            violates the liberties or rights of others. Of course,
            violation of another person's liberty or right provides
            *a* moral reason, but it's unclear that it provides a
            *conclusive* moral reason---think about, say, cases of
            self-defense.
        
        -   The *Walker* Court's reason: Peace and order.
        
            -   Again, this cannot be a conclusive reason.
        
            -   It also fails to appreciate King's distinction between
            negative and positive peace.

## Justifying Civil Disobedience

-   Rawls argues that civil disobedience is justified when three
    conditions are met:

    1.  It is limited to "instances of substantial and clear injustice,
        and preferably to those which obstruct the path to removing
        other injustices."

    2.  "\[T\]he normal appeals to the political majority have already
        been made in good faith and that they have failed."

    3.  It is coordinated with and limited by other oppressed groups'
        right to dissent in order "to regulate the overall level of
        dissent."

-   Let's focus on the second and the third conditions.

    -   Rawls' second condition can be seen as a response to *Walker*.

        -   The *Walker* majority refused to consider the
            constitutionality of the injunction the demonstrators
            violated or the constitutionality of the Birmingham city
            ordinance that underlay the injunction on the grounds that
            the demonstrators did not bother to challenge them in court
            before they went ahead and disobeyed them.

            -   The *Walker* majority chastised the demonstrators for
                presuming to be judges in their own case, quoting an
                Alabama Supreme Court opinion: "As a general rule, an
                unconstitutional statute is an absolute nullity and may
                not form the basis of any legal right or legal
                proceedings, yet until its unconstitutionality has been
                judicially declared in appropriate proceedings, no
                person charged with its observance under an order or
                decree may disregard or violate the order or the decree
                with immunity from a charge of contempt of court; and he
                may not raise the question of its unconstitutionality in
                collateral proceedings on appeal from a judgment of
                conviction for contempt of the order or decree."

        -   However, the dissents pointed out that the demonstrators had
            good reason to believe legal attempts at redress would be
            futile. As Justice Douglas described one of the
            demonstrators' prior attempts, "\[Mrs. Lola Hendricks who
            was authorized by the demonstrators to apply for a permit\]
            then went to the office of Commissioner Eugene 'Bull' Connor
            and told him that 'we came up to apply or see about getting
            a permit for picketing, parading, demonstrating.' She asked
            Connor for the permit, 'asked if he could issue the permit,
            or other persons who would refer me to, persons who would
            issue a permit.' Commissioner Connor replied, 'No, you will
            not get a permit in Birmingham, Alabama to picket. I will
            picket you over to the City Jail.' "

        -   In contrast, Rawls' second condition does not require the
            *exhaustion* of normal means of redress. It requires only
            that attempts "have already been made in good faith and that
            they have failed."

        -   Still, you might think this is too demanding. Consider
            King's point on "Wait!" and "Never!":

            -   "Some have asked: 'Why didn't you give the new city
                administration time to act?' . . . Lamentably, it is an
                historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up
                their privileges voluntarily.

            -   "We know through painful experience that freedom is
                never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be
                demanded by the oppressed. . . . For years now I have
                heard the word 'Wait!' . . . This 'Wait' has almost
                always meant 'Never.' We must come to see, with one of
                our distinguished jurists, that 'justice too long
                delayed is justice denied.' "

    -   Rawls' third condition is motivated by two worries:

        -   First, "there is a limit on the extent to which civil
            disobedience can be engaged in without leading to a
            breakdown in the respect for law and the constitution."

        -   Second, "\[t\]here is also an upper bound on the ability of
            the public forum to handle such forms of dissent; the appeal
            that civilly disobedient groups wish to make can be
            distorted and their intention to appeal to the sense of
            justice of the majority lost sight of."

        -   Rawls' solution is what he calls "a cooperative political
            alliance of the minorities." A cooperative political
            alliance can coordinate the actions of different minorities
            to give each minority an opportunity to voice their dissent.

            -   Think about, perhaps, the disability rights movement.
                Disability, as Elizabeth Barnes argues, is best
                understood as a category based on group solidarity: "I
                want to say that disability is socially constructed from
                group solidarity. A group of people with a variety of
                physical conditions got together and observed that their
                experiences of their bodies had something in common.
                They used that commonality to organize themselves in a
                civil rights struggle aimed at promoting justice for
                people with bodies they judged to be importantly similar
                (and to give rise to importantly similar experiences) to
                their own. Disability, as a category, is constructed
                from that solidarity among people with physically
                non-standard bodies."[^1]

        -   But is Rawls' third condition more of a strategic constraint
            or a moral constraint? Why should the burden of managing the
            overall level of dissent to fall onto minority groups?
