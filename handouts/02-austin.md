# John Austin, Selections from *The Province of Jurisprudence Determined*

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## The Proper Subject Matter of Jurisprudence

-   Austin's account can be seen as a response to natural law theory.

    -   Recall that, for natural law theorists, a law is legally valid
        in part in virtue of the fact it satisfies certain moral
        requirements. For example, on Aquinas' account, a law is legally
        valid in part in virtue of the fact that it is derived from
        principles of reason, and, if a law fails to satisfy the
        requirements of reason (that is, it is unjust), it is no law at
        all.

    -   For legal positivists, however, it's important to appreciate two
        points:

        -   *Conceptual Separability Thesis*: What the law is and what
            the law ought to be are two conceptually separable
            questions. It's possible for a law to be legally valid even
            if it fails to be moral or just.

        -   *Social Thesis*: A law is legally valid entirely in virtue
            of certain social, non-moral facts.

-   Austin begins by clarifying what the law is, *properly understood*.

    -   There are two categories of laws that are worthy of the name:

        -   Positive law, that is, the collection of "laws set \[that
            is, posited\] by political superiors to political
            inferiors." They are laws "simply and strictly so called."

            -   Austin claims that the positive law is the proper
                subject matter of jurisprudence.

        -   Divine law, that is, the collection of "laws set by God to
            men."

            -   These are bona fide laws, but they are not the proper
                subject matter of jurisprudence.

    -   There are a couple of categories of things that are called
        "law," but *improperly*:

        -   Positive morality, or people's actual beliefs about morality
            (without regard to whether these beliefs do end up tracking
            morality).

            -   For example, it's conceivable that there could be a
                society where people believe murder is morally
                permissible. That's positive morality, but it's not law,
                properly understood.

        -   Law of honor, law set by fashion, law of etiquette, and so
            on.
        -   These are also not law, properly understood.
        
    -   Physical laws, biological laws, and so on.
        
        -   Likewise, they are not law, properly understood.

## Austin's Analysis of Law as a Species of Commands

-   Austin then offers us an analysis of law that does not have morality
    baked in: On his account, laws are *general commands of a sovereign
    to their subjects*.
    -   A *command* is "the expression of \[a\] wish," but not any kind
        of expression of a wish: it has to be backed up by a threat to
        "inflict an evil or pain in case the desire be disregarded."
    
        -   Example:
    
            -   Suppose I tell you, "I encourage you to do this
                assignment, but it's okay if you don't." That's not a
                command on Austin's account because it is not backed up
                by sanctions for noncompliance.
    
            -   Instead, a command must be something like, "Do this
                assignment or you will get a 0."
    
        -   This analysis of command, according to Austin, also provides
            an analysis of *obligation*: I have a duty to obey your
            command just in case I am "liable to evil from you if I
            comply not with a wish which you signify." We will come back
            to this point later when we discuss Hart.
    
    -   However, not any commands backed up by sanctions are laws. The
        kind of commands worthy of the name "law" must be *general*
        in the sense that these commands concern a *class* of acts, not
        any specific act.
        -   For example, suppose a parent tells their kid, "You must go
            to bed at 10pm tonight, or else . . ." That's a specific
            command because the parent is commanding the kid to go to
            bed at 10pm *tonight*.
        
        -   In contrast, "You must go to bed at 10pm *from now on*, or
            else . . ." is a general command because the parent is
            commanding the kid to act in a *general* way.
        
    -   The *sovereign* is a determinate and common superior who is
        habitually obeyed by the bulk of a society, but does not
        habitually obey anyone else.
        -   *Determinate and common*: The sovereign must be one specific
            individual (or aggregate of individuals) and the same
            individual (or aggregate of individuals).
        
        -   *Superior*: The sovereign has the power to enforce
            compliance with their wishes by inflicting sanctions.
        
            -   Note that this analysis of superiority does not appeal
                to any facts about morality. An individual (or aggregate
                of individuals) is the superior as long as they have the
                power to impose sanctions to enforce their wishes,
                whether or not this power is legitimate.
        
        -   *Habitually obeyed*: The subjects' obedience to the
            sovereign is not just occasional or transient.
            -   Likewise, the habit of obeying the sovereign is merely a
                habit---an entirely social fact. It doesn't matter if
                the subjects ought to obey the sovereign in any morally
                heavy-duty sense.
            
        -   *By the bulk of society*: the sovereign must be obeyed by
            the bulk of the population.
        
        -   *Not habitually obeying anyone else*: The sovereign must be
            the superior in an ultimate sense.
            -   For example, the Mayor of Tucson would not be the
                sovereign because they still habitually obey the
                Governor of Arizona.
    
-   Again, Austin's analysis of law as a species of commands is a legal
    positivist analysis. Indeed, morality does not figure anywhere in
    his analysis.

    -   Austin's analysis respects the Conceptual Separability Thesis:
        In order for something to be law, it need only be a general
        command of the sovereign to their subjects that is backed up by
        sanctions for noncompliance. Whether this command/law satisfies
        the requirements of morality is a separate question.

    -   Austin's analysis respects the Social Thesis: A law is legally
        valid in virtue of the fact that it is a general command of a
        sovereign to their subjects that is backed up by sanctions for
        noncompliance, which is a social fact, not a moral fact.

## Putative Counterexamples to Austin's Analysis

-   To laws as a species of *commands*:

    -   Austin notes that three types of laws do not seem to be
        commands, even though they are cases of positive or human-made
        law:

        -   Laws that explain existing laws.

        -   Laws that repeal existing laws.

            -   Austin: "They are not commands, but revocations of
                commands"

        -   Laws that are not backed up by sanctions.

    -   Austin's response: "But the space occupied in \[jurisprudence\]
        by these improper laws is comparatively narrow and
        insignificant. Accordingly, although I shall take them into
        account so often as I refer to them directly, I shall throw them
        out of account on other occasions. Or (changing the expression)
        I shall limit the term *law* to laws which are \[commands\],
        unless I extend it expressly to laws which are not."

-   To laws as commands of the *sovereign*:

    -   Laws made by judges do not seem to be commands of the sovereign,
        but they are, of course, cases of positive or human-made law.

    -   Austin's Response: Although laws made by judges are not made by
        the sovereign directly, they are the sovereign's *tacit*
        commands because judges are "ministers" or "delegates" of the
        sovereign.
