## The Difference Approach

-   The dominant approach to sex discrimination is the difference
    approach (a.k.a. the differences approach), which is committed to
    three theses:
    -   *The ontological thesis*: Sex is a matter of natural division or
        difference.
    
    -   *The evaluative thesis*: Being a woman is merely different, not
        worse than being a man.
    
    -   *The normative thesis*: The fact that sex represents a neutral
        and natural division means women should be treated the same as
        men to the extent that women and men share commonalities, but
        *only to that extent*.
    
-   As MacKinnon puts it,

    -   "The fundamental assumption underlying the differences view is
        that a primordial sphere exists in which people are
        undifferentially human, the same across the sex difference.
        Overlaid is a sphere in which biological differences immutably
        create gender identity, a sphere in which the sexes are
        different but equivalent. Women's different social status is
        seen to be rationally explained by these differences."

    -   In other words:

        -   Insofar as women share some of men's characteristics (those
            that are "undifferentially human"), women and men are
            comparable, and so they should be treated the same.

        -   But beyond those characteristics, the "differences" that
            women have mean women and men are not similarly situated,
            and so women should not be treated the same as men insofar
            as women are different from men.

        -   Because sex is a *mere* difference, not a bad difference,
            treating women separately cannot be treating them unequally.
            It is the true separate but equal.

        -   As MacKinnon puts it elegantly, the mandate of the
            difference approach is really that "biologically different
            people are to be treated the same except when their
            biological differences are relevant."

-   On the difference approach, the relevant question to be asked in
    assessing the permissibility of a sex-based classification, then, is
    whether the biological differences are *relevant*, that is, whether
    the differential treatment is grounded properly in those biological
    differences and thus *not arbitrary*.

    -   This is how courts are instructed to assess sex-based
        classifications: whether the sex-based classification is
        *rationally related* to a legitimate state interest that the
        statute is supposed to serve.

    -   Intermediate scrutiny does not help. It only raises the bar of
        what counts as a *reasonable* differentiation---from
        "*rationally related* to a *legitimate* state interest" to
        "*substantially related* to an *important* state interest."

    -   Even strict scrutiny may not help. It would raise the bar once
        again---from "*substantially related* to an *important* state
        interest" to "*narrowly tailed* to a *compelling* state
        interest."

    -   At bottom, all three tests ask whether biological differences
        can justify differential treatment, that is, whether there is
        some *fitting* relationship between the two. If there are, the
        differential treatment is not arbitrary and so there is no sex
        discrimination. If there are not, then there is a failure of
        *neutrality*, and neutrality is all that gender equality
        requires.

## MacKinnon's Argument against the Difference Approach

-   MacKinnon argues that the difference approach is inadequate.

    -   The easy way to see how this is so is to consider a couple of
        cases where the difference approach evidently yields the wrong
        verdict.

    -   Then we will discuss MacKinnon's explanation for *why* the
        difference approach fails.

-   Consider, first, a modified version of *Reed*:

    -   Recall that, in *Reed*, the Idaho statute required mandatory
        preference for males over females in appointment as
        administrator of estate.

    -   The Court found administrative efficiency a state interest that
        was "without some legitimacy." However, the Court struck down
        the statute anyway because mandatory preference for males was
        not rationally related to administrative efficiency.

    -   But suppose it *is* the case that most women are illiterate and
        lack financial skills.

        -   This sort of assumption is important because in a sexist
            society---a society in which women urgently need protections
            against sex discrimination---women often *are not* a par
            with men. It is a self-fulling prophecy: Women are thought
            to be bad at reading, managing finances, etc. So. they are
            not given opportunities to learn to read, to manage
            finances, etc. Then, of course, they *are* bad at reading,
            managing finances, etc.

    -   In this society, it seems mandatory preference for males is
        rationally related to administrative efficiency, and so it is
        not discrimination.

        -   This is the wrong result. Under the difference approach, the
            more sexist a society is, the less sex discrimination there
            is. That is absurd.

    -   But, even within a society where most women are literate and
        have financial skills, the problem still remains---it means
        discrimination against the most disadvantaged women is not
        discrimination precisely because they are the most disadvantaged
        women. Indeed, their disadvantage might make them *differently*
        situated, and erases the very possibility of them even being
        able to be discriminated against at a conceptual level.

        -   As MacKinnon puts it, "\[T\]he differences approach, as a
            requisite to finding discrimination, has in mind people who
            have not been damaged by racism or sexism, who are in the
            same position as corresponding whites and men, but have
            irrationally and arbitrarily been treated differently. The
            theory proceeds by comparing people who, because of social
            inequality, are simply noncomparable; clearing that hurdle,
            it then looks to see if the group on the bottom deserves to
            be treated equally to the group on the top. To the extent to
            which such groups really are not equal, their status is
            found legally justified, each situated 'difference'
            supporting further accumulations of enforced inferiority.
            The approach protects primarily women who for all purposes
            are socially men, blacks who for all purposes are socially
            white, leaving untouched those whose lives will never be the
            same as the more privileged precisely because of race or
            sex."

-   Now consider the pregnancy discrimination cases:

    -   In *Geduldig* (the constitutional interpretation case) and
        *Gilbert* (the statutory interpretation case), the Court held
        that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status was not
        discrimination on the basis of sex.

    -   The difference approach would lead to the same conclusion: For
        there to be arbitrary treatment, there has to be differential
        treatment that can't be justified. For there to be differential
        treatment, however, there must be someone else who's in the same
        boat as you but is treated differently. Yet, there is *no
        differential treatment* in the case of pregnancy discrimination
        because there is simply no one that women can be compared
        against.
        -   Some of you might wonder: Wait, isn't that really that the
            Court being cissexist? Wouldn't just realizing trans men,
            intersex people, and trans masculine nonbinary people exist solve the
            no-comparator problem?
            -   Let's try to work this out a little bit. Let's say the
                employer employs both binary trans men and cis women.
            
            -   Now, following the difference approach, the question is
                whether cis women and trans men are treated the same
                given they are similarly situated---do trans men get
                pregnancy coverage when cis women don't?
            
            -   That seems to be the problem: if the employer does not
                offer pregnancy coverage *at all*, then cis women and
                trans men are not treated differently, and so there is
                no failure of neutrality, no sex discrimination and no
                violation of equal protection.
            
            -   That seems to be the wrong result: employers can get
                away with sex discrimination if they just be *more*
                sexist and perhaps also pepper some cissexism into the
                mix.
    
-   So, why does the difference approach fail?

    -   Let's recall the three theses the difference approach subscribes
        to:

        -   *The ontological thesis*: Sex is a matter of natural
            division or difference.

        -   *The evaluative thesis*: Being a woman is not a bad
            difference, but a *mere* difference.

        -   *The normative thesis*: The fact that sex represents a
            neutral and natural division means women should be treated
            the same as men to the extent that women and men share
            commonalities, but *only to that extent*.

    -   MacKinnon rejects all three of them.

        -   For MacKinnon, the ontological thesis fails to see sex is
            really an *inequality* disguised as a natural difference.
            Indeed, it seems that, on MacKinnon's conception, patterns
            of sexual differences, even differences that might seem
            natural, are really *products* and *symptoms* of inequality.
            -   MacKinnon explains, "A division which produces
                inequality may seem natural because of inequality so
                pervasive it has seldom been questioned or been
                rationally questionable. The social inequality inherent
                in the lack of physical training for women, for example,
                may express itself in women's lesser physical strength,
                a difference which comes to seem natural primarily
                because it is a physical fact. That the sex division
                seems natural may measure how deeply sex divides social
                consciousness better than it measures the givenness of
                characteristics of the sexes or justifies sex as a
                foundation for social disparity. That sex seems a
                natural division may reveal not the appropriateness of
                the grouping but the degree to which a social perception
                that sex is a matter of differentness has buried itself
                in nature and reemerged in society clothed as what the
                society means by a natural difference. The conception of
                the natural---and its contents---remain social ideas. To
                pattern a society after what seems natural, in this
                perspective, is to pattern it after an idea of the
                natural that is itself social and thereby to sanctify
                that social idea. Further, while sex may be a 'natural
                joint' at which to carve the universe, it may not be a
                natural point at which to subordinate one group to the
                other. The social universe is not only carved up, it is
                also hierarchically ordered."
            
        -   The key, then, is to understand sex not as a mere difference
            but as a *hierarchy*. That is the only relevant meaning of
            sex:
        
            -   "The issue is not that some differences are social while
                others are biological but which of the social
                disadvantages of sex courts will prohibit. In this
                perspective, the point of the *Gilbert* case is that the
                disadvantage, hence the discrimination, lies not in the
                biological fact of pregnancy but in the policy which
                transforms it into a detriment to women who work outside
                the home. The only relevant meaning in sex difference,
                in \[my view\], is a social creation, springing from
                social imperatives."
        
        -   Of course, to say the relevant sexual differences are really
            socially constituted or caused is not to say the differences
            are not real, or are trivial.
        
            -   "Nor, in \[my view\], is the social meaning of being
                biologically female 'merely' social in the sense of
                being superficial, its detriments magically eradicable
                by being legally ignored. Instead, the society may tend
                to create women in its image of their inferior status,
                as a group largely lacking in skills, experience, sense
                of self, 'qualifications.' Sexually, women may tend to
                be passive in accepting male sexual initiation because
                they have been taught it is feminine and because men
                give them little choice. Although many women will resist
                this imposed image, it has reality. Women may be
                seductive to the same extent and for the same reasons,
                which may include their survival. These realities are as
                much a concrete foundation and persistent basis for
                women's social existence as is pregnancy, and are just
                as firmly (if not as exclusively) based on sex. To see
                the natural as social instead---as nature made
                social---is to see the concrete *content* of the sex
                difference as the systemic, structural, and determinate
                subordination of women to men in all social spheres.
                When this *is* the sex difference, its perpetuation is
                seen to be not accidental but determinate, in that men
                as a group are benefitted while women have little choice
                but to stay in their place."
        
        -   The relevant normative issue, then, is not whether women are
            treated *arbitrarily* (by comparison to men), but whether
            women are treated *disadvantageously*. That is, whether
            sexual differences are *transformed* into disadvantages for
            women and privileges for men, contributing to women's
            subordinate social position.

## The Dominance Approach

-   MacKinnon's alternative is the dominance approach (a.k.a. the
    inequality approach), or perhaps we can also call it the *subordination*
    approach.
    -   *The ontological thesis*: Sex is a matter of inequality,
        disadvantage or subordination.
    
    -   *The evaluative thesis*: Being a woman is to occupy a
        subordinate social position---to be systematically, structurally
        and non-incidentally disadvantaged *because* one is a woman.
    
    -   *The normative thesis*: The fact that sex represents a
        hierarchical system that distributes privileges and
        disadvantages means we should bring an end to this hierarchical
        system and put women on the same plane as men.
    
-   To further compare the two, let's consider how each approach would
    determine if there is sex discrimination:

    -   The difference approach

        -   The first question the difference approach asks is whether
            women are treated *differently* than men.

            -   If not (e.g., pregnancy discrimination), then there is
                no sex discrimination.

        -   The next question is whether women are treated *arbitrarily*
            compared to men.

            -   If not (e.g., most women really are better at child
                care), then there is no sex discrimination.

    -   The dominance approach

        -   The dominance approach asks only one question: are women
            treated *as less* than men?

            -   The analysis ends here. There is no need to consider
                whether women are treated differently or arbitrarily, or
                even whether the sexual differences are real or
                imagined. These questions are simply irrelevant.

-   Example: laws that offer women special protections or perks

    -   Consider the Florida statute involved in *Hoyt*: Women are
        automatically exempted from jury duty (unless they themselves
        request to serve), but men are not.

    -   How would the difference approach analyze this statue?

        -   The difference approach first asks: are women treated
            *differently* than men?

            -   It seems so.

        -   It then asks: are women treated *arbitrarily* compared to
            men?

            -   No, because giving women the exclusive perks of not
                having to serve on juries is justified by sexual
                differences---they are *compensations* for their special
                responsibilities as mothers and wives.

    -   How about the dominance approach?

        -   The only question the dominance approach asks is: are women
            treated *as less* than men?

            -   Yes, because the automatic exclusion tends to
                disadvantage women by confining them to a Woman's Place
                and depriving them of equal participation in political
                and social life. That's the end of the inquiry.

-   Another example: stereotypes

    -   MacKinnon quotes Chief Justice Burger's comments during oral
        argument in *Phillips v. Martin Marietta*, which concerned an
        employer's policy of hiring men with preschool children but not
        women with preschool children:

        -   "\[F\]rom many years of \[my\] contact with industry, . . .
            women are manually much more adept than men and they do this
            kind of work better than men do it, and that's why you hire
            women. . . . For just the same reason that most men hire
            women as secretaries, because they are better at it than
            men. . . . The Department of Justice, I am sure, doesn't
            have any male secretaries. This is an indication of it. They
            hire women secretaries because they are better and you hire
            women assembly people because they are better."

    -   Let's consider such a case: an employer refuses to hire women as
        managers, but also refuses to hire men as secretaries based on
        stereotypical assumptions of women's and men's skills.

    -   What would the difference approach say about such a case?

        -   Crucially, it depends on whether the stereotypes reflect
            reality.

        -   If a stereotype has no factual basis, then it cannot bear
            the kind of rational fitting relationship required under the
            difference approach.

            -   As Justice Ginsburg puts it in her majority opinion in
                *United States v. Virginia*, justification for
                differential treatment "must not rely on overbroad
                generalizations about the different talents, capacities,
                or preferences of males and females."

        -   But what if the generalizations are not over broad? What if
            a stereotype is, for that matter, actually *true*? Recall
            our hypothetical based on *Reed*: What if, actually, no
            women are literate and have experiences managing finances?

            -   That would be a *real* difference that *can* rationalize
                differential treatment.

            -   MacKinnon asks, "Certainly many untrue stereotypes of
                women exist; certainly many women do not fit stereotypes
                that may correctly describe most women. But what about
                the ones that are true? What about the women whom the
                stereotypes describe? What if, because a stereotype has
                set a standard that most women have had little choice
                but to meet, few women have escaped being measured
                against and shaped by it? Why should the exceptional
                individual, who can argue that the stereotype does not
                apply to her, be the only one who can assert that the
                stereotype disadvantages her, when most women live a
                sex-stereotyped reality?"

        -   The problem becomes especially pressing when we consider how
            stereotypes can indeed *create* reality:

            -   "Consider, for example, the current stereotype that
                women are more appropriate as full-time parents of
                preschool children than men. If men universally bore no
                responsibility for child care, it would be no sex
                stereotype for a company to refuse to consider hiring
                women on that basis, and it would be small consolation
                to mothers if women without preschool children---that
                is, women who met the male standard---were allowed to
                apply. The answer seems to be that sex-stereotyping
                based upon illusion is prohibited, while a sex
                stereotype powerful enough to become a social reality
                justifies itself."

    -   The dominance approach, on the other hand, would have no problem
        dealing with factually-grounded stereotypes.

        -   For the dominance approach, sex stereotypes are the products
            and symptoms of women's social *subordination*. The fact
            that many sex stereotypes are true reflects, in sharp
            contrast to the difference approach, how incredibly *sexist*
            our society is.

            -   "An inequality \[or dominance\] perspective . . .
                reverses the causation implicit in the customary
                'stereotype' view and suggests that a major factor that
                insures that women will develop personality
                characteristics, skills, and behavior corresponding to
                the female stereotype is the availability of jobs which
                make women's economic survival largely contingent upon
                such qualities and skills and not others. If women's
                manual aptitude, sensitivity to the whims of customers
                and employers, adept cleaning, ability to support egos
                and anticipate needs, and to make an environment
                congenial were considered desirable employee qualities
                in men, men would probably develop them."

        -   MacKinnon's insight here is that stereotypes are wrongful
            not because they are *illusional*, but *because they are
            real*:

            -   "\[I\]t is not the *illusion* that blacks are less
                likely to have certain job qualifications and are more
                likely to be poor and to have arrest records or
                dishonorable discharges that gives rise to the cause of
                action---it is the *reality*."

        -   Thus, to evaluate whether stereotypes are real and thus have
            a rational bearing on differential treatment is to
            completely miss the point of equal protection.

            -   "The point of these cases is their recognition of the
                socially created, systemic, historical, and
                group-defined character of racial status. In such cases,
                no investigation has been required into whether the
                specific individual or even blacks in general were in a
                position that led to more arrests, more undesirable
                discharges, fewer diplomas, or lower incomes. Such an
                investigation would have to conclude with either the
                white supremacist view that blacks as a group are
                genetically less accomplished, more prone to crime and
                misconduct, and less deserving of well-paying jobs, or
                that these results, to the extent observable, are
                effects of a racist social system, that is, 'prior
                discrimination' in a broadly social sense."

-   A last example: affirmative action

    -   Suppose a school district uses sex as a tie breaker when
        assigning students to public schools. A parent sues on the
        grounds that the policy discriminates against their son.

    -   How would the difference approach analyze the sex discrimination
        claim?

        -   The difference approach first asks: would the son be treated
            *differently* if he were a girl?

            -   Suppose the answer is yes.

        -   The next question is: is the son treated *arbitrarily* as a
            result?

            -   The question is at best extraordinarily controversial.

            -   It seems that, if arbitrary treatment against girls is
                possible, then, of course, *reverse* arbitrary treatment
                against boys must be possible. To suggest otherwise is,
                as MacKinnon puts it, "analytically uncomfortable to the
                point of collapse."

    -   But how about the dominance approach?

        -   Again, the only question for the dominance approach is: are
            boys thereby treated *as less* than girls?

            -   No, on quite the contrary, it is because *girls* are
                treated as less than boys that affirmative action is
                needed so that girls can be put on an equal footing with
                boys. As MacKinnon explains, "Affirmative action plans.
                . . are steps toward empowering that group whose
                depowering is the problem. There is no illusion that
                groups of people are subordinated by . . . 'race' and
                'sex,' the mechanical reversal of which will result in
                reverse subordination. These categories are seen to
                codify and facilitate social inferiority, the agents and
                beneficiaries of which are not abstractions but other
                people---in particular, the other half of the
                abstraction: those whites and men who have been
                cumulatively advantaged by the subordination and
                exclusion of blacks and women. In this perspective,
                white males have long been advantaged precisely on
                racial and sexual grounds, differentially favored in
                employment and education *because* they were white and
                male. To intervene to alter this balance of advantage is
                not discrimination in reverse, but a chance for equal
                consideration for the first time."

-   A remaining problem: pregnancy discrimination

    -   We already know that the difference approach struggles to make
        sense of pregnancy discrimination because there is no
        differential treatment if sexual differences are salient in the
        context.

    -   But how might the dominance approach handle pregnancy
        discrimination?

        -   MacKinnon thinks the answer is easy:

            -   "Under inequality logic, by contrast, it is neither
                necessary for all women to get pregnant for that
                distinction to be sex-based nor possible that such a
                fact could justify sex-differential treatment. To
                deprive a woman, for example, of disability pay because
                she is pregnant discriminates on the basis of sex
                because pregnancy has a *direct* relation to sex, and
                produces immediate disadvantages for employment for
                women only---and that is the end of the argument."

        -   In other words:

            -   On the difference approach, because no men can get
                pregnant, pregnancy discrimination is not discrimination
                against women.

            -   On the dominance approach, because no men can get
                pregnant, pregnancy discrimination *is* discrimination
                against women.

    -   But this seems to suppose there is a valid and clear-cut
        *division* between women and men that tracks a *real* natural
        difference. You might think that is problematic for a couple of
        reasons:

        -   First, and, most obviously, it means binary/nonbinary trans
            men, trans masculine nonbinary people, and intersex people who do not
            identify as women have to choose between
            1.  Not being able to be discriminated against on the basis
                of pregnancy at all because they are not women; and
            
            2.  Being misgendered by the law in order to be seen as
                worthy of being discriminated against on the basis of
                pregnancy.
        
    -   But, second, this is not just a problem for binary/nonbinary
            trans men, trans masculine nonbinary people, and intersex people, but
            for *cis* men as well. *Newport v. EEOC* (1983) provides
            such an example. In that case, the employer provided less
            extensive pregnancy coverage for the spouses of male
            employees than for the spouses of female employees (of
            course, as the Court understood it, "the sex of the spouse
            is always the opposite of the sex of the employee," but it
            didn't seem to affect the Court's reasoning). Recognizing
            that Congress had reversed the Court in *Gilbert*, the
            *Newport* Court ruled that the male employee was
            discriminated against on the basis of *his* sex (a similarly
            situated female employee would receive more extensive
            spousal pregnancy coverage).
        
    -   Third, there is a problem too for *cis* women who can't get
            pregnant. In explaining why pregnancy discrimination
            discriminates against women, MacKinnon writes, "Few women
            have the security of knowing whether or how long they are in
            the class of 'all women' as opposed to the class of
            'pregnant persons'; no man faces this problem." This is bad
            reasoning. If a cis woman can't get pregnant and so finds
            out she too does not face this problem, does that mean she
            is officially excluded from "the class of 'all women' " and
            joining the class of men?
        
    -   Altogether, the problem runs deep conceptually: To argue
            that pregnancy discrimination is sex discrimination
            *because* pregnancy is in some sense intrinsic or "direct"
            to (one) sex is to overlook, if not completely neglect, the
            fact that pregnancy discrimination does not have to be based
            on the *actual* ability to get pregnancy---the *perception*
            that one might get pregnant (*cis and trans* women,
            effeminate cis men, and trans men and nonbinary people
            misgendered as women) or the *association* with someone that
            can get pregnant (e.g., a partner) can also be sex
            discriminatory.
            -   But, even to agree on the basis of the *actual* ability
            to get pregnancy makes it indefensibly difficult for
                binary/nonbinary trans men, trans masculine nonbinary people, and
                intersex people who *can* get pregnant to make
                pregnancy-based sex discrimination claims.
            
        -   This is the kind of issues that my research focuses on and
        which keeps me up at night :-)
