# Sex Discrimination

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## Roadmap for the Rest of the Class

-   *Reed v. Reed* (1971) was a watershed moment in the Court's sex
    discrimination jurisprudence. Until *Reed*, the U.S. Supreme Court
    had never struck down any statute on the grounds that it
    discriminated on the basis of sex.
    -   In this module, we will discuss how the Court treated sex
        discrimination prior to *Reed*, what legal strategy helped bring
        *Reed* about, what the Court's holding in *Reed* was, and how
        the Court's sex discrimination doctrine developed after *Reed*.
    
    -   In the next module, we will discuss two influential critiques of
        the dominant doctrinal treatment of sex discrimination
        post-*Reed*.
    
    -   Afterwards, we will explore the relationship between sex
        discrimination and employment discrimination against LGBTQ+
        employees (Module 9), sexual harassment (Module 10),
        reproductive freedom (Module 11), and educational discrimination
        against transgender students (Module 12).

## Notable Sex Discrimination Cases Prior to *Reed*

-   *Bradwell v. Illinois* (1873)
    -   *Facts*: The Illinois Supreme Court denied the plaintiff Myra
        Bradwell's license to practice law in that state on the grounds
        that she was a married woman.
    
    -   *Held*: The denial did not violate Myra Bradwell's rights under
        the 14th Amendment.
    
    -   Remarkably, Justice Bradley wrote a separate concurrence in
        which he seemingly reached beyond the law and appealed to some
        version of substantive natural law:
    
        -   "\[T\]he civil law, as well as nature herself, has always
            recognized a wide difference in the respective spheres and
            destinies of man and woman. Man is, or should be, woman's
            protector and defender. The natural and proper timidity and
            delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it
            for many of the occupations of civil life. The constitution
            of the family organization, which is founded in the divine
            ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the
            domestic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain
            and functions of womanhood."
    
    -   What about women who are unmarried?
    
        -   "It is true that many women are unmarried and not affected
            by any of the duties, complications, and incapacities
            arising out of the married state, but these are exceptions
            to the general rule. The paramount destiny and mission of
            woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and
            mother. This is the law of the Creator. And the rules of
            civil society must be adapted to the general constitution of
            things, and cannot be based upon exceptional cases."
    
    -   But is Justice Bradly just expressing sexist attitudes? Well, he
        would certainly resist that characterization:
    
        -   "The humane movements of modern society, which have for
            their object the multiplication of avenues for woman's
            advancement, and of occupations adapted to her condition and
            sex, have my heartiest concurrence. But I am not prepared to
            say that it is one of her fundamental rights and privileges
            to be admitted into every office and position, including
            those which require highly special qualifications and
            demanding special responsibilities. In the nature of things
            it is not every citizen of every age, sex, and condition
            that is qualified for every calling and position. It is the
            prerogative of the legislator to prescribe regulations
            founded on nature, reason, and experience for the due
            admission of qualified persons to professions and callings
            demanding special skill and confidence. This fairly belongs
            to the police power of the State; and, in my opinion, in
            view of the peculiar characteristics, destiny, and mission
            of woman, it is within the province of the legislature to
            ordain what offices, positions, and callings shall be filled
            and discharged by men, and shall receive the benefit of
            those energies and responsibilities, and that decision and
            firmness which are presumed to predominate in the sterner
            sex."
    
            -   This point is important and will resurface again and
                again: For Justice Bradly, laws denying women access to
                offices and positions are justified because women are
                *different* from men---women have different
                "characteristics, destiny, and mission." In this sense,
                being a woman is just like any other job qualification.
                You wouldn't think refusing to hire someone as a senior
                software engineer because they don't know how to code is
                unjustified discrimination. Likewise, as Justice Bradly
                seems to think, women don't have a protected right under
                the 14th Amendment to practice law because being a woman
                (like not knowing how to code) *disqualifies* them from
                the legal profession. It isn't inequality or unjustified
                discrimination, because men and women are simply *not
                comparable*.
    
-   *Muller v. Oregon* (1908)

    -   *Facts*: Curt Muller owned a laundry in Portland. He allowed his
        manager to require a woman employee to work more than 10 hours
        on September 4, 1905. Muller was subsequently fined \$10 for
        violating an Oregon statute which provided "\[t\]hat no female
        \[shall\] be employed in any mechanical establishment, or
        factory, or laundry in this State more than ten hours during any
        one day."

    -   *Held*: The Oregon statute is constitutional.

    -   Justice Brewer, writing for a unanimous Court, reasons as
        follows:

        -   "That woman's physical structure and the performance of
            maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the
            struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true
            when the burdens of motherhood are upon her. Even when they
            are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity
            continuance for a long time on her feet at work, repeating
            this from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the
            body, and as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous
            offspring, the physical well-being of woman becomes an
            object of public interest and care in order to preserve the
            strength and vigor of the race."

        -   "Still again, history discloses the fact that woman has
            always been dependent upon man. He established his control
            at the outset by superior physical strength, and this
            control in various forms, with diminishing intensity, has
            continued to the present. As minors, though not to the same
            extent, she has been looked upon in the courts as needing
            especial care that her rights may be preserved. Education
            was long denied her, and while now the doors of the school
            room are opened and her opportunities for acquiring
            knowledge are great, yet even with that and the consequent
            increase of capacity for business affairs it is still true
            that in the struggle for subsistence she is not an equal
            competitor with her brother. . . . Doubtless there are
            individual exceptions, and there are many respects in which
            she has an advantage over him; but looking at it from the
            viewpoint of the effort to maintain an independent position
            in life, she is not upon an equality. Differentiated by
            these matters from the other sex, she is properly placed in
            a class by herself, and legislation designed for her
            protection may be sustained, even when like legislation is
            not necessary for men and could not be sustained. It is
            impossible to close one's eyes to the fact that she still
            looks to her brother and depends upon him. Even though all
            restrictions on political, personal and contractual rights
            were taken away, and she stood, so far as statutes are
            concerned, upon an absolutely equal plane with him, it would
            still be true that she is so constituted that she will rest
            upon and look to him for protection; that her physical
            structure and a proper discharge of her maternal
            functions---having in view not merely her own health, but
            the well-being of the race---justify legislation to protect
            her from the greed as well as the passion of man. The
            limitations which this statute places upon her contractual
            powers, upon her right to agree with her employer as to the
            time she shall labor, are not imposed solely for her
            benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all. Many words
            cannot make this plainer. The two sexes differ in structure
            of body, in the functions to be performed by each, in the
            amount of physical strength, in the capacity for
            long-continued labor, particularly when done standing, the
            influence of vigorous health upon the future well-being of
            the race, the self-reliance which enables one to assert full
            rights, and in the capacity to maintain the struggle for
            subsistence. This difference justifies a difference in
            legislation and upholds that which is designed to compensate
            for some of the burdens which rest upon her."

-   *Goesaert v. Cleary* (1948)

    -   *Facts*: Valentine Goesaert owned a bar in Michigan. She and her
        daughter, Margaret Goesaert, wanted to tend their bar. A
        Michigan statute prohibited women from working as bartenders
        unless they were "the wife or daughter of the male owner."

    -   *Held*: The Michigan statute is consistent with the Equal
        Protection Clause.

    -   Justice Frankfurter, writing for a 6-3 majority, thinks the
        question is easy, "To ask whether or not the Equal Protection .
        . . Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred Michigan from
        making the classification the State has made between wives and
        daughters of owners of liquor places and wives and daughters of
        non-owners, is one of those rare instances where to state the
        question is in effect to answer it."

        -   "We are, to be sure, dealing with a historic calling. We
            meet the alewife, sprightly and ribald, in Shakespeare, but
            centuries before him she played a role in the social life of
            England. . . . The Fourteenth Amendment did not tear history
            up by the roots, and the regulation of the liquor traffic is
            one of the oldest and most untrammeled of legislative
            powers. Michigan could, beyond question, forbid all women
            from working behind a bar. This is so despite the vast
            changes in the social and legal position of women. The fact
            that women may now have achieved the virtues that men have
            long claimed as their prerogatives and now indulge in vices
            that men have long practiced, does not preclude the States
            from drawing a sharp line between the sexes, certainly in
            such matters as the regulation of the liquor traffic. . . .
            The Constitution does not require legislatures to reflect
            sociological insight, or shifting social standards, any more
            than it requires them to keep abreast of the latest
            scientific standards."

        -   "The Constitution in enjoining the equal protection of the
            laws upon States precludes irrational discrimination as
            between persons or groups of persons in the incidence of a
            law. But the Constitution does not require situations 'which
            are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as
            though they were the same.' "

    -   Three justices would strike down the statute, but not because
        the statute discriminates against women *bartenders*, but
        because it discriminates against women *liquor shop owners*.
        Justice Rutledge writes,

        -   "The statute arbitrarily discriminates between male and
            female owners of liquor establishments. A male owner,
            although he himself is always absent from his bar, may
            employ his wife and daughter as barmaids. A female owner may
            neither work as a barmaid herself nor employ her daughter in
            that position, even if a man is always present in the
            establishment to keep order. This inevitable result of the
            classification belies the assumption that the statute was
            motivated by a legislative solicitude for the moral and
            physical well-being of women who, but for the law, would be
            employed as barmaids."

            -   The distinction is important: if Michigan had
                categorically prohibited women from working as
                bartenders without providing the "wife or daughter of
                the male owner" exception, it's unclear how it would
                still have violated Equal Protection (after all,
                bartering is such a dangerous profession for women?).

-   Justice Bradley's concurrence in *Bradwell*, the Court's unanimous
    opinion in *Muller*, and Justice Frankfurter's majority opinion in
    *Goesaert* (and perhaps even the dissent in *Goesaert*) make plain
    three interwoven, long-standing themes in the dominant doctrinal
    conception of sex discrimination:

    -   *Woman's Place*: There is a Woman's Place, distinct from the
        places, roles and professions that men can occupy.
        -   This Woman's Place is natural and based on scientific facts
            (*Muller*) or perhaps even divinely ordained (Justice
            Bradley in *Bradwell*).
        
        -   The Woman's Place is the place of Mother/Wife, which is
            explained and justified by women's special "needs" and
            "functions." For the *Muller* Court, the Woman's Place as
            Mother/Wife makes "the physical well-being of woman . . . an
            object of public interest and care" because it bears
            directly on "the well-being of the race."
        
    -   *Discrimination as Protection*: Laws that restrict women's
        rights and freedom are not discrimination against them, but
        *protections for* them.
        -   As the *Muller* Court puts it, "That woman's \[note the
            singular form again\] physical structure and the performance
            of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the
            struggle for subsistence is obvious." Because women are not
            only disadvantaged by laws, but also (and perhaps more
            importantly) *limited by nature*, special protection laws
            need to be put in place to help them in their uniquely
            challenging "struggle for subsistence."
        
        -   On this conception, laws that specifically restrict women's
            working hours or occupations are *favors* to women. It's
            unthinkable how any woman would be so ungrateful as to
            complain about them!
        
    -   *Equal Protection as Absence of Arbitrary Treatment*: What equal
        protection forbids is arbitrary treatment---that is, similarly
        situated persons must be treated similarly.
    
        -   However, if equal protection is just the absence of
            arbitrary treatment, then there are two kinds of cases where
            it's conceptually impossible for there to be a violation of
            equal protection:
    
            -   No arbitrary treatment if no differential treatment:
                If two persons are not in relevantly similar shoes, they
                cannot be treated *differently*, and, *a fortiori*, they
                cannot be treated differently in an arbitrary way.
    
            -   No arbitrary treatment if differential treatment is
                justified: If there is good reason to treat two persons
                in similar shoes differently, they are not treated
                *arbitrarily* even though they are treated differently.
    
        -   Think about, perhaps:

            -   Professors can assign grades to students, but students
                cannot assign grades to themselves. However, this
                (hopefully) does not discriminate against students
                because professors and students are not similarly
                situated.
    
            -   Professors assign different grades to different
                students. However, this (again, hopefully) does not
                discriminate against students because there is good
                reason to assign one grade to one student, a different
                grade to another, etc.
    
        -   For both the *Muller* Court and the *Goesaert* Court, women
            and men are not similarly situated, so questions about
            discrimination simply cannot arise as a conceptual matter.
    
-   We see these three themes culminate in *Hoyt v. Florida* (1961):

    -   *Facts*: Gwendolyn Hoyt's husband had a history of being
        unfaithful. In early 1957, Gwendolyn Hoyt discovered her husband
        was being unfaithful again. After repeated failed attempts to
        save their marriage, she got into an argument with the husband.
        She eventually flew into a rage and hit him over the head with
        her son's broken baseball bat. The husband later died. An
        all-male jury convicted Gwendolyn Hoyt of second-degree murder.
        She argued that her rights under the 14th Amendment were
        violated by a Florida statute which automatically exempted women
        from jury duty unless they themselves requested to serve.

    -   *Held*: The Florida statute is constitutional.

        -   The Court notes that the Florida statute did not
            automatically exclude women from jury *service*---although
            their names were automatically excluded from jury lists,
            they could choose to be put on jury lists *if they so
            desire*.
            -   Again, this is considered a favor---indeed, a
                "privilege" as the Court puts it---to women. The Court
                explains, "Despite the enlightened emancipation of women
                from the restrictions and protections of bygone years,
                and their entry into many parts of community life
                formerly considered to be reserved to men, woman is
                still regarded as the center of home and family life. We
                cannot say that it is constitutionally impermissible for
                a State, acting in pursuit of the general welfare, to
                conclude that a woman should be relieved from the civic
                duty of jury service unless she herself determines that
                such service is consistent with her own special
                responsibilities." (Note the evident *Woman's Place* and
                *Discrimination as Protection* assumptions.)
            
        -   The *Hoyt* Court does entertain the argument that the
            privilege is in fact exclusionary of women.
        
            -   Here, it seems the *Hoyt* Court is assuming, *for the
                sake of argument*, that men and women are similarly
                situated. The question, then, is whether the
                differential treatment is *arbitrary*. The Court applies
                rational basis review: "Where, as here, an exemption of
                a class in the community is asserted to be in substance
                an exclusionary device, the relevant inquiry is whether
                the exemption itself is based on some reasonable
                classification and whether the manner in which it is
                exercisable rests on some rational foundation."
        
            -   The Court concludes that it isn't: the statute serves
                the reasonable function of giving women the special
                perks of not having to serve on juries, in light of
                their duty "as the center of home and family life."
                Clearly, we see the *Equal Protection as Absence of
                Arbitrary Treatment* assumption driving the Court's
                analysis.

## Pauli Murray and Mary Eastwood, "Jane Crow and the Law: Sex Discrimination and Title VII"

-   By the end of the mid- and late-1970s, two facts were becoming
    increasing apparent to women in the civil rights movement, the New
    Left movement and an emerging new wave of feminist movement:

    -   There is striking similarity between sex, race, class and caste
        in the sense that they are all *systems of domination*.

        -   Of course, this is not to say experiences of inequality are
            the same.

    -   Unlike the case with other systems of domination, the fact that
        women are subordinated *because of their sex* often remains
        invisible and even inconceivable.

        -   Two decades ago, the Court in *Brown* already recognized
            separate-but-equal public education is *inherently* unequal.

            -   But courts hesitated to apply the same logic to contexts
                other than race.

        -   Perhaps even more notably, in *Loving v. Virginia* (1967), a
            unanimous Court struck down a Virginia statute that
            prohibited interracial marriage, despite the Virginia
            government's objection that the statute satisfied the
            requirements of the Equal Protection Clause because it
            applied to different races *equally*.

            -   Chief Justice Warren, writing for himself and seven
                other members of the Court, went over and beyond to
                declare miscegenation laws as "measures designed to
                maintain White Supremacy."

            -   In light of this understanding, the majority held that
                the mere fact that the Virginia statute creates a
                classification based on race warranted special judicial
                scrutiny: "There can be no question but that Virginia's
                miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions
                drawn according to race. The statutes proscribe
                generally accepted conduct if engaged in by members of
                different races. Over the years, this Court has
                consistently repudiated '\[d\]istinctions between
                citizens solely because of their ancestry' as being
                'odious to a free people whose institutions are founded
                upon the doctrine of equality.' *Hirabayashi* v. *United
                States*, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943). At the very least, the
                Equal Protection Clause demands that racial
                classifications, especially suspect in criminal
                statutes, be subjected to the 'most rigid scrutiny,'
                *Korematsu* v. *United States*, 323 U.S. 214, 216
                (1944)."

            -   The Virginia statute cannot survive strict scrutiny, and
                the equal application objection cannot save it: "Because
                we reject the notion that the mere 'equal application'
                of a statute containing racial classifications is enough
                to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth
                Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial
                discriminations, we do not accept the State's contention
                that these statutes should be upheld if there is any
                possible basis for concluding that they serve a rational
                purpose. The mere fact of equal application does not
                mean that our analysis of these statutes should follow
                the approach we have taken in cases involving no racial
                discrimination . . . \[where\] the Court has merely
                asked whether there is any rational foundation for the
                discriminations, and has deferred to the wisdom of the
                state legislatures. In the case at bar, however, we deal
                with statutes containing racial classifications, and the
                fact of equal application does not immunize the statute
                from the very heavy burden of justification which the
                Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state
                statutes drawn according to race."

            -   Justice Stewart, the only justice not in the majority,
                would strike down the statute with just two sentences:
                "I have previously expressed the belief that 'it is
                simply not possible for a state law to be valid under
                our Constitution which makes the criminality of an act
                depend upon the race of the actor.' Because I adhere to
                that belief, I concur in the judgment of the Court"
                (internal citation omitted).

        -   However, even though the Court recognizes race as a suspect
            classification subject to strict scrutiny and thus views all
            statutes that rely on a race-based classification with a
            presumption of *invalidity* (the burden is on the government
            to persuade the Court that it is in fact *not invalid*), the
            Court does not do so in sex discrimination cases---statutes
            that rely on a sex-based classification are presumptively
            *valid* unless there is a strong showing to the country on
            the part of the challenger. Indeed, by this point, the Court
            has *never* struck down any sex discriminatory laws under
            the 14th Amendment.

-   One groundbreaking article that helped bring about the watershed
    moment in the Court's treatment of sex discrimination was authored
    by Pauli Murray and Mary Eastwood.
    -   Pauli Murray was a queer Black legal scholar, a poet and the
        first Black woman-presenting person to become an Episcopal
        priest. Murray likely met co-author Mary Eastwood while serving
        on a study committee of President Kennedy's Commission on the
        Status of Women (more on this later).
    
    -   Murray and Eastwood explicitly drew on insights from the civil
        rights movement to argue that sex discrimination is also a form
        of discrimination and named it "Jane Crow." As Murray and
        Eastwood note, sex discrimination is "strikingly parallel" to
        racial discrimination in two respects:
    
        -   *Factual claim*: Both sexism and racism claim that one group
            (women, Black people) is inferior in some important ways
            (intelligence, etc.) but superior in some other ways (caring
            children, cleaning floor, etc.).
    
        -   *Normative claim*: Both sexism and racism take the natural
            differences between the relevant groups (women and men,
            Black people and white people) to *justify* separate places
            for each group.
            -   Notably, the things women and Black people are thought
                to be naturally better at tend to *confine* them to jobs
                and roles that are lower paying (or not paid at all),
                less respected and with less room for career
                advancement. The separate places are not equal.
            
            -   This produces a vicious circle: women and Black people
                are denied rights and opportunities because they are
                thought to be inferior, and then this is used as
                evidence for their lack of achievement and, thus,
                inferiority.
            
            -   The assumption that women and Black people are inferior
                and that only particular kinds of work suit them also
                leads to all sorts of other myths: that laws that
                restrict women and Black people to their places are
                actually protective, that there is the "contended woman"
                or the "contented Black person" who does not want equal
                rights and does not cause trouble, etc.
        
    -   An important reason why sex discrimination has not been
        recognized as discrimination has to do with the relative
        *subtlety* of sex discrimination. But, for Murray and Eastwood,
        that's not a reason to dismiss sex discrimination as *trivial*:
    
        -   "These findings indicate that, in matters of discrimination,
            the problems of women are not as unique as has been
            generally assumed. That manifestations of racial prejudice
            have been more brutal than the more subtle manifestations of
            prejudice by reason of sex in no way diminishes the force of
            the equally obvious fact that the rights of women and the
            rights of Negroes are only different phases of the
            fundamental and indivisible issue of human rights."
            (footnote omitted)
    
    -   A compounding issue, however, is the Equal Rights Amendment
        (ERA).
    
        -   The ERA would guarantee that "\[e\]quality of rights under
            the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States
            or by any state on account of sex." There was increasing
            momentum to pass and ratify the ERA at the time (of course,
            as we know, the 1982 ratification deadline has expired).
    
        -   As Murray and Eastwood point out, the general consensus
            among both the proponents and opponents of the ERA at the
            time was that the 14th Amendment did not already protect
            women's equality under the law---"a constitutional gap," as
            Murray and Eastwood call it, which needed to be filled by
            the ERA.
    
            -   This is confirmed by the Supreme Court's approach to sex
                discrimination. As we said, it was not until the
                beginning of the following decade that the Court struck
                down a sex discriminatory law as violative of the 14th
                Amendment.
    
        -   However, Murray and Eastwood resist the idea that ERA is the
            only possible way forward. Instead, they think the Equal
            Protection Clause provides another path. They write,
    
            -   "Although the Supreme Court has in no case found a law
                distinguishing on the basis of sex to be a violation of
                the fourteenth amendment, the amendment may nevertheless
                be applicable to sex discrimination. The genius of the
                American Constitution is its capacity, through judicial
                interpretation, for growth and adaptation to changing
                conditions and human values. . . . Courts have not yet
                fully realized that women's rights are a part of human
                rights; but the climate appears favorable to renewed
                judicial attacks on sex discrimination as suggested by
                the President's Commission on the Status of Women.
    
            -   "The protective cover of the fourteenth amendment is
                broad enough to reach all arbitrary class
                discrimination. . . . The difficulty in asserting
                women's rights lies not in the limited reach of the
                fourteenth amendment, but in the failure of the courts
                to isolate and analyze the discriminatory aspect of
                differential treatment based on sex."
    
        -   As we will see again and again, this incongruence between
            what the law is and what the law ought to be is a recurring
            theme in civil rights struggles broadly.
    
            -   We can perhaps understand the general consensus that
                there is a constitutional gap as a version of legal
                positivism: The Constitution does not prohibit sex
                discrimination. It would be a mistake to say it does
                just because it ought to. In order to change what
                Constitution says to what it ought to say, we have to
                pass a constitutional amendment.
    
            -   Are Murray and Eastwood then committed to an
                indefensible version of natural law theory? There is
                perhaps a better way to make sense of their claim: Note
                that, for Murray and Eastwood, what needs fixing is not
                that the Constitution did not *originally* prohibit sex
                discrimination and so now we should change it---without
                passing a constitutional amendment---so it says what it
                should say. Instead, the problem is courts have failed
                to *recognize* that the Constitution does indeed
                prohibit sex discrimination. I think the most natural
                interpretation is by way of something like a Dworkinian
                moral reading of the Constitution. That is, even though
                the Framers did not *expect*, when they wrote the 14th
                Amendment, that it would prohibit sex discrimination,
                they didn't write (and, for that matter, shouldn't have
                written) "equal protection of the laws *as we understand
                it*." What was enacted into the law was the general,
                abstract moral principle of equality protection of the
                laws, not the Framer's conception of that principle, or
                the public's conception at the time, or even the courts'
                conception *right now*. What the courts need to realize,
                on this interpretation of Murray and Eastwood, is that
                equal protection of the laws does *in fact* prohibit sex
                discrimination.
    
    -   But, how should the courts recognize sex discrimination as sex
        discrimination? Isn't there still the worry that the state must
        have a legitimate interest in protecting maternal and familial
        functions, which are carried out by women? If so, then sex
        discrimination can be justified by a state interest in "the
        well-being of the race."
    
        -   Murray and Eastwood gave a response that was probably well
            ahead of its time:
    
            -   "But in discussing the legal status of women, courts
                generally have been content to parrot the doctrine that
                sex forms the basis of a reasonable classification and
                to ignore the fact that women vary widely in their
                activities and as individuals. What is needed to remove
                the present ambiguity of women's legal status is a shift
                of emphasis from women's class attributes (sex per se)
                to their *functional* attributes. The boundaries between
                social policies that are genuinely protective of the
                familial and maternal functions and those that unjustly
                discriminate against women as individuals must be
                delineated" (emphasis in original).
    
            -   "To the degree women perform the function of motherhood,
                they differ from other special groups. But *maternity*
                legislation is not *sex* legislation; its benefits are
                geared to the performance of a special service much like
                veterans' legislation. When the law distinguishes
                between the 'two great classes of men and women,' gives
                men a preferred position by accepted social standards,
                and regulates the conduct of women in a restrictive
                manner having *no bearing* on the maternal function, it
                disregards individuality and relegates an entire class
                to inferior status" (my emphasis).
    
            -   "If laws dassifying persons by sex were prohibited by
                the Constitution, and if it were made dear that laws
                recognizing functions, *if performed*, are not based on
                sex per se, much of the confusion as to the legal status
                of women would be eliminated. Moreover, this may be the
                only way to give adequate recognition to women who are
                mothers and homemakers and who do not work outside the
                home-it recognizes the intrinsic value of child care and
                homemaking. The assumption that financial support of a
                family by the husband-father is a gift from the male sex
                to the female sex and, in return, the male is entitled
                to preference in the outside world is all too common.
                Underlying this assumption is the unwillingness to
                acknowledge any value for child care and homemaking
                because they have not been ascribed a dollar value"
                (emphasis in original).
    
        -   We will circle back to this issue later on, but let me note
            for now that there are probably two readings of these
            passages:
            -   *The weak reading*: Maternity legislation and sex
                legislation are conceptually *distinct*, even though
                some legislation *can* be both maternity and sex
                legislation.
            
            -   *The strong reading*: Maternity legislation and sex
                legislation are conceptually *exclusive*, that is, if
                some legislation is maternity legislation, it cannot be
                sex legislation.
            
        -   The divergence between the two readings is most starkly
            illustrated in the case of pregnancy discrimination.
        
            -   In an infamous case, *Geduldig v. Aiello* (1974), the
                Court held that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy
                status does not constitute discrimination on the basis
                of sex under the Equal Protection Clause.
        
            -   Two years later, in *General Electric v. Gilbert*
                (1976), the Court applied the *Geduldig* reasoning to
                hold that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy
                status likewise does not constitute discrimination on
                the basis of sex under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
                of 1964.
        
            -   Indeed, the decisions were so ridiculously outrageous
                that Congress amended Title VII with the Pregnancy
                Discrimination Act of 1978, legislatively overruling
                *Gilbert* (but not *Geduldig*, which would most likely
                require a constitutional amendment to overrule).
        
        -   While the strong reading might support the claim that
            discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status cannot also
            be discrimination on the basis of sex, the weak reading does
            not. But how to argue pregnancy discrimination is also sex
            discrimination (especially a subset of sex discrimination)
            turns out to be more conceptually complicated than it might
            appear at first (think about why).
    
-   For Murray and Eastwood, sex discrimination implicates a similar
    kind of separate-but-equal treatment.

    -   "It may not be too far-fetched to suggest that this doctrine as
        presently applied has implications comparable to those of the
        now discredited doctrine of 'separate but equal.' It makes the
        legal position of women not only ambiguous but untenable.
        Through unwarranted extension, it has penalized all women for
        the biological function of motherhood far in excess of
        precautions justified by the findings of advanced medical
        science. Through semantic manipulation, it permits a policy
        originally directed toward the protection of a segment of a
        woman's life to dominate and inhibit her development as an
        individual. It reinforces an inferior status by lending
        governmental prestige to sex distinctions that are carried over
        into those private discriminations currently beyond the reach of
        the law.

    -   ". . . \[J\]ust as separate schools for Negro and white children
        by their very nature cannot be 'equal,' classification on the
        basis of sex is today inherently unreasonable and
        discriminatory."

## *Reed v. Reed* (1971)

-   Social change in the background:

    -   In December 1961, a newly-elected Kennedy established the
        President's Commission on the Status of Women (Murray served on
        the Commission's Committee on Civil and Political Rights), which
        published a widely discussed report, *American Women*, in 1963.
        Analogous state commissions were also created to study women's
        inequality.

    -   Also in 1963, Betty Friedan published her influential book, *The
        Feminine Mystique*, which became an early voice that helped
        bring about a new wave of feminist movement---the women's
        liberation movement.

    -   The newly enacted Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited sex-based
        employment discrimination, and the Equal Employment Opportunity
        Commission (EEOC) was created in 1965.

    -   In 1966, Friedan co-founded (along Murray and others) the
        National Organization for Women (NOW) and became its first
        president.

    -   From 1967 to 1968, numerous women's liberation groups began to
        emerge all across the country. In September 1968, a group based
        in New York---New York Radical Women (NYRW)---led a "No More
        Miss America" protest in Atlantic City, bringing national media
        attention to the emerging movement.

    -   By the end of the decade, the movement was growing rapidly and
        forcibly, making women's equality an issue impossible to avoid.

-   ACLU involvement:

    -   The American Civil Liberties Union did not initially support the
        ERA. Murray (who joined the ACLU board of directors in 1965) and
        another brilliant lawyer Dorothy Kenyon (who you might remember
        from the *Reed* brief; Kenyon had been on the board of directors
        since 1930) became a duo in urging the ACLU to take on gender
        inequality.

    -   At a September 1970 meeting, the board was going to discuss the
        ERA. Murray and Kenyon sent the following telegraph to the board
        after receiving the materials: "Board materials include paper on
        Equal Rights Amendment written by four *men* law professors and
        (inadvertently) not one syllable from any women. We are aghast
        at such gallant effrontery. Hell hath no rage greater than a
        woman scorned. Beware of more materials." (emphasis in original)

    -   Murray and Kenyon eventually persuaded the ACLU board both to
        endorse the ERA and to litigate sex discrimination cases under
        the Equal Protection Clause.

-   Ginsburg's involvement:

    -   Murray and Eastwood's article helped then-Professor Ginsburg at
        Rutgers Law School to develop one of the first courses in the
        country on women and the law.

    -   While teaching at Rutgers, Ginsburg also began to consult and
        work on sex discrimination cases for ACLU. One of them was
        *Reed v. Reed*.

-   The case

    -   Sally Reed was a single mother raising a teenage son, Richard,
        in Boise, Idaho. Richard died tragically while he was visiting
        his father, who had long been separated from Sally Reed. She
        filed a petition to be the administrator of Richard's estate,
        but the ex-husband also filed a petition. Under an Idaho
        statute, "males must be preferred to females" in appointment as
        administrator of estate. An Idaho probate judge thus denied
        Sally Reed's petition.

    -   As Ginsburg put it decades later, "Sally Reed was not a
        sophisticated woman. She earned her living by caring for elderly
        people, taking them into her home. She probably did not think of
        herself as a feminist, but she had the strong sense that her
        State's law was unjust."

    -   Sally Reed found a local Idaho lawyer, Allen Derr, to represent
        her. She appealed the probate judge's decision to an Idaho state
        district court where she argued the Idaho statute was
        unconstitutional. The state district court agreed, but the Idaho
        Supreme Court reversed. She did not give up and decided to
        appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

    -   Ginsburg and fellow ACLU lawyers noticed Sally Reed's case and
        thought it was the perfect vehicle to bring the first sex
        discrimination claim under the Equal Protection Clause to the
        U.S. Supreme Court: The facts were simple, how the case should
        come out was intuitive, and it vividly illustrated
        discrimination women experience *because* they are women.

    -   Ginsburg co-wrote Sally Reed's U.S. Supreme Court brief with
        ACLU's legal director Mel Wulf. Even though Murray and Keyon did
        not work on the brief, Ginsburg included their names on the
        brief as co-counsel to acknowledge their intellectual influence.
        Allen Derr, Sally Reed's original Idaho lawyer, argued the case
        orally.

-   The brief

    -   In the brief, Ginsburg and co-counsel present the Court with a
        choice between two positions: a principal position and a
        fallback position.

    -   *Principal position*: Drawing on the analogy between racial
        discrimination and sex discrimination, Ginsburg et al.'s argue
        that the Court should treat sex as a suspect class on a par with
        race. That is, sex-based classifications should be subject to
        strict scrutiny.
        -   In order to survive strict scrutiny, the statute must be
            *narrowly tailored* to achieve a *compelling* state
            interest.
        
            -   Strict scrutiny is a very difficult test to the point of
                being called "strict in theory, fatal in fact."
        
        -   The Idaho statute would fail strict scrutiny miserably.
        
    -   *Fallback position*: But, even if the Court does not want to
        recognize sex as a suspect class like race just yet, Ginsburg et
        al. argue it should still strike down the Idaho statute under
        rational basis review.
        -   In order to survive rational basis review, the statute must
            be *rationally related* to achieve a *legitimate* state
            interest.
        
            -   Rational basis review is a very lenient test---it's
                often very easy to find at least *some* legitimate state
                interest that a statute has *some* relational connection
                to.
        
        -   Preferably, Ginsburg et al. argue, the Court should apply a
            modified, slightly beefed-up version of rational basis
            review: Instead of asking the challenger to argue that the
            statute is *irrational*, it should ask the government to
            argue that the statute is *rational*.
        
        -   However, even if the Court does not want to use the modified
            version of rational basis review, Ginsburg et al. continue
            to argue, the Idaho statute is so irrational that it cannot
            even survive the run-of-the-mill version of rational basis
            review: the statute cannot be connected to any legitimate
            state interest.
    
-   The Court's decision

    -   A unanimous Court rules for Sally Reed, striking down a statute
        for discrimination on the basis of sex for the first time in its
        history.

    -   But the Court does not respond to Ginsburg et al.'s principal
        position at all. Instead, the Court strikes down the statute
        using rational basis review.

        -   The Court manages to find a state interest in "the objective
            of reducing the workload on probate courts by eliminating
            one class of contests," which, the Court says, "is not
            without some legitimacy." (This seems to table the question
            of whether the Court should apply the modified version of
            rational basis review.)

        -   However, the Court holds that using a sex-based
            classification to achieve that interest is "arbitrary" and
            cannot stand under the Equal Protection Clause.

## The Court's Sex Discrimination Doctrine After *Reed*

-   After Reed's victory, the ACLU board voted to make women's rights
    its top legal and legislative priority.

    -   In the spring of 1972, the ACLU board decided to fund a women's
        rights project (WRP) and invited Ginsburg to lead it.
        (Tragically, Dorothy Kenyon died later that in year.)

    -   The WRP litigated and participated in a series of sex
        discrimination cases, with the ultimate aim of getting the Court
        to recognize sex as a suspect class.

        -   A recurring theme in these cases is sex discrimination is a
            double-edged sword that harms not only women but also men.

    -   The Court came close to declaring sex a suspect class in just a
        year and a half after *Reed*.

-   *Frontiero v. Richardson* (1973)
    -   *Facts*: Lieutenant Sharron Frontiero married Joseph Frontiero a
        year after she joined the Air Force. Federal statutes allowed
        members of the military to claim housing and healthcare benefits
        for their dependents. The statutes presumed the wives of male
        members of the military were dependent on their husbands, which
        allowed a husband to claim his wife regardless of whether his
        wife was in fact dependent on him. However, the statutes
        required female members of the military to prove that their
        husbands were in fact dependent on them in order to claim the
        benefits. Because Joseph Frontiero's income was so low, the
        percentage math required by the statutes didn't work out in
        their favor. Sharron Frontiero was denied the benefits. The
        district court affirmed the constitutionality of the statutes.
    
    -   Ginsburg was involved extensively in the case, working in
        coordination with Sharron Frontiero's Southern Poverty Law
        Center (SPLC) counsel Joseph J. Levin, Jr.
        -   As *amicus*, Ginsburg kept pushing the Court to declare sex
            a suspect class and apply strict scrutiny, but she also
            continued her *Reed* strategy, arguing that the statutes
            cannot survive even rational basis review.
        
        -   This time, she also offered the Court a proper mid-tier
            scrutiny as the third option: "the legislation is 'closely
            scrutinized,' and the proponent of the challenged
            classification is required to show that it is 'necessary to
            the accomplishment of legitimate \[legislative\]
            objectives.' " (internal citations omitted)
        
    -   To Ginsburg's surprise, four justices came onboard, endorsing
        strict scrutiny for sex-based classifications. This was
        especially shocking given it was only a year and a half ago that
        the Court for the first time struck down a sex discriminatory
        statute.
    
        -   However, four justices were just one vote short of a
            majority.
    
        -   Indeed, even though eight justices voted to strike down the
            law, there was no majority reasoning in *Frontiero*.
    
        -   Some justices were, at least ostensibly, worried about
            "acting prematurely and unnecessarily" in light of the
            pending ratification of the ERA, which had been passed by
            Congress in 1972 and, at the time, was thought to be almost
            on track to be ratified. (Of course, as we know, that didn't
            happen, but the Court's decision remained.)
    
-   *Craig v. Boren* (1976)

    -   *Facts*: An Oklahoma statute prohibited the sale of 3.2% beer to
        women under 18 but to men under 21. Carolyn Whitener, a beer
        vendor, and Mark Walker, a freshman at Oklahoma State University
        who wanted to buy beer, challenged the statute. The district
        court ruled against them, and they appealed.

    -   Ginsburg was also involved in *Craig* along with the case's
        original counsel, Fred Gilbert.
        -   *Craig* represented a significant change in Ginsburg's
            litigation strategy. Realizing there weren't five votes for
            strict scrutiny (Ginsburg was becoming increasing sensitive
            to political and strategic considerations, like the ERA in
            the background coupled with some justices' worry that the
            Framers of the 14th Amendment did not intend to cover sex
            discrimination, as well as a couple of cases such as
            *Geduldig v. Aiello* in which the Court went the other way),
            Ginsburg still pushed for heightened scrutiny for sex-based
            classification, but no longer for strict scrutiny.
        
    -   In *Craig*, the Court does end up adopting a new intermediate
        scrutiny for sex-based classifications:
    
        -   In order to survive intermediate scrutiny, the statute must
            be *substantially related* to achieve an *important* state
            interest.
    
        -   The Court holds that the Oklahoma statute fails this test
            and is thus unconstitutional.
    
-   *United States v. Virginia* (1996)

    -   *Facts*: The Virginia Military Institute (VMI) had a male-only
        admission policy. The United States sued Virginia on the grounds
        that VMI's admission policy violated the Equal Protection
        Clause. Virginia defended the policy by appealing to a state
        interest in "diversity in educational approaches." The district
        court upheld the policy, but the court of appeals reversed. Now,
        Virginia went to court a second round with a proposal: as a
        remedy for the equal protection violation, Virginia would
        establish a parallel program for women, the Virginia Women's
        Institute for Leadership (VWIL), which would differ from VMI in
        terms of training method (VMI uses a rigorous adversative
        method, VWIL a cooperative one), funding, faculty and prestige.
        The district court found the remedy adequate, and the court of
        appeals affirmed.

    -   Perhaps the most notable change that occurred between *Craig*
        and this case is then-advocate Ginsburg is now Justice Ginsburg.
        In 1980, Ginsburg was appointed to the D.C. Circuit from her
        positions at the ACLU Women's Rights Project and Columbia Law
        School. In 1993, she was elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court.

    -   Writing for a 7-1 Court (with Justice Thomas recused and Justice
        Scalia dissenting), Justice Ginsburg applies intermediate
        scrutiny, holds VMI's male-only admission policy violates the
        Equal Protection Clause, and finds VWIL an inadequate remedy.

        -   What's especially interesting is how Justice Ginsburg
            explains intermediate scrutiny: "To summarize the Court's
            current directions for cases of official classification
            based on gender: Focusing on the differential treatment or
            denial of opportunity for which relief is sought, the
            reviewing court must determine whether the proffered
            justification is 'exceedingly persuasive.' The burden of
            justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the
            State. The State must show 'at least that the \[challenged\]
            classification serves "important governmental objectives and
            that the discriminatory means employed" are "substantially
            related to the achievement of those objectives." ' The
            justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented
            *post hoc* in response to litigation. And it must not rely
            on overbroad generalizations about the different talents,
            capacities, or preferences of males and females."

            -   First, intermediate scrutiny requires "exceedingly
                persuasive justification."

            -   Second, a statute that relies on on a sex-based
                classification is presumptively *invalid*, and the
                burden is on the state to show that it is indeed not
                invalid.

            -   Third, the state's justification "must be genuine, not
                hypothesized or invented *post hoc* in response to
                litigation."

            -   Fourth, the state's justification "must not rely on
                overbroad generalizations about the different talents,
                capacities, or preferences of males and females."

        -   In his dissent, Justice Scalia worries that "\[o\]nly the
            amorphous 'exceedingly persuasive justification' phrase, and
            not the standard elaboration of intermediate scrutiny, can
            be made to yield this conclusion that VMI's single-sex
            composition is unconstitutional."

        -   Questions:

            -   Is the "exceedingly persuasive justification" standard
                the same as intermediate scrutiny, somewhere in between
                intermediate scrutiny and strict scrutiny, or really
                strict scrutiny in disguise?

            -   Should sex be treated as a suspect classification?
                (Think about: women's colleges, affirmative action,
                etc.)
