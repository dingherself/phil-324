# The Equal Protection Clause

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## A Note

-   For purposes of our course, you will need to know at least what
    each of Amendments I--X, XIII--XV and XIX protects, prohibits, or
    otherwise prescribes.
    -   For example, you will need to know *that* the Fourth Amendment
        prohibits "unreasonable searches and seizures," even though you
        might not know what exactly constitutes an unreasonable search
        or seizure under current case law.
    
-   Our specific focus is the application and interpretation of the
    Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

    -   Because the Equal Protection Clause is closely connected to the
        Due Process Clause, we will also discuss the Due Process Clause
        in some detail to help ourselves better understand the Equal
        Protection Clause.

## Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
> state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law
> which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
> United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life,
> liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any
> person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

## State Action Doctrine

-   The Equal Protection Clause covers only *state*, as opposed to
    private, actions (with caveats).

-   On its face, though, the Equal Protection Clause seems to cover even
    less: The text of the Equal Protection Clause explicitly covers only
    state actions by a *state* government, not the *federal* government.

    -   In *Bolling v. Sharpe* (1954)---*Brown*'s companion case which
        challenged the racial segregation of public schools in
        D.C.---the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection
        Clause applies to the federal government via the Due Process
        Clause of the Fifth Amendment:
        -   "The Fifth Amendment, which is applicable in the District of
            Columbia, does not contain an equal protection clause, as
            does the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies only to the
            states. But the concepts of equal protection and due
            process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness,
            are not mutually exclusive. . . . \[A\]s this Court has
            recognized, discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be
            violative of due process." (499)
    
-   What makes an action a *state* action?

    -   The paradigmatic case is perhaps actions directly carried out by
        the government: laws passed by Congress or a state legislature,
        actions carried out by a state agent acting in their official
        capacity, etc.

    -   But things escalate from there pretty quickly: for example, how
        we should think about actions carried out by a private actor
        which serve a public function?
        
    -   (See the [supplemental note on the sovereign immunity doctrine](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/handouts/01-sovereign-immunity.md) for how these issues became salient in the year leading up to the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision overruling *Roe v. Wade*.)

-   Importantly, even though the Equal Protection Clause in general does
    not apply to private actions, it does not prohibit federal and
    state/local governments from making laws to outlaw private conduct
    that is discriminatory.

    -   For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits
        employment discrimination "because of . . . race, color,
        religion, sex, or national origin" by both private and public
        employers with fifteen or more employees.

    -   Likewise, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972's
        prohibition against educational discrimination "on the basis of
        sex" applies to both private and public institutions that
        receive federal financial assistance.

    -   These are, however, not constitutional protections.

## What Is Equal Protection?

-   The Court has traditionally followed an *anticlassification*
    approach to conceptualizing the requirements of the Equal Protection
    Clause.

    -   The anticlassification approach takes the Equal Protection
        Clause to prohibit the government from *classifying* people in
        indefensible ways.

    -   For example, in *Hoyt v. Florida* (1961), the Court considered a
        Florida law which provided that "the name of no female person
        shall be taken for jury service unless said person has
        registered with the clerk of the circuit court her desire to be
        placed on the jury list."
        -   The Equal Protection Clause applies because the case clearly
            concerns a state action---a law passed by a state
            legislature.
        
        -   The anticlassification approach construes the law as
            creating a gender-based classification with respect to
            automatic inclusion on jury lists.
        
        -   The constitutional question, then, is whether such a
            classification is defensible.
    
-   When determining the constitutionality of a statute that involves a
    classification, courts are required, under the Court's current equal
    protection jurisprudence, to apply different tests (with different
    levels of scrutiny) based on the nature of the classification in
    question:

    -   Suspect classifications (e.g., race) receive **strict
        scrutiny**:
        -   The statute must serve a *compelling* government interest;
            and
        
        -   The statute must do so by means that are *narrowly tailored*
            to achieve that interest.
        
    -   Protected classifications (e.g., sex) receive **intermediate
        scrutiny**:
    
        -   The statute must serve an *important* government interest;
            and
    
        -   The statute must do so by means that are *substantially
            related* to achieving that interest.
    
    -   Other classifications (e.g., age) receive **rational basis
        review**:
    
        -   The statute must serve a *legitimate* government interest;
            and
    
        -   The statute must do so by means that are *rationally
            related* to achieving that interest.
    
-   In our example, the *Hoyt* Court ruled that the Florida law did not
    violate the Equal Protection Clause.

    -   Notably, the case was before the Court in *Craig v.
        Boren* (1976) created intermediate scrutiny and applied it to
        sex-based classifications.

    -   The *Hoyt* Court reasoned:

        -   "Where, as here, an exemption of a class in the community is
            asserted to be in substance an exclusionary device, the
            relevant inquiry is whether the exemption itself is based on
            some reasonable classification and whether the manner in
            which it is exercisable rests on some rational foundation.

        -   "In the selection of jurors, Florida has differentiated
            between men and women in two respects. It has given women an
            absolute exemption from jury duty based solely on their sex,
            no similar exemption obtaining as to men. And it has
            provided for its effectuation in a manner less onerous than
            that governing exemptions exercisable by men: women are not
            to be put on the jury list unless they have voluntarily
            registered for such service; men, on the other hand, even if
            entitled to an exemption, are to be included on the list
            unless they have filed a written claim of exemption as
            provided by law.

        -   "In neither respect can we conclude that Florida's statute
            is not 'based on some reasonable classification,' and that
            it is thus infected with unconstitutionality. Despite the
            enlightened emancipation of women from the restrictions and
            protections of bygone years, and their entry into many parts
            of community life formerly considered to be reserved to men,
            woman is still regarded as the center of home and family
            life. We cannot say that it is constitutionally
            impermissible for a State, acting in pursuit of the general
            welfare, to conclude that a woman should be relieved from
            the civic duty of jury service unless she herself determines
            that such service is consistent with her own special
            responsibilities." (61--62)

## Topics We Will Discuss Later in the Class

-   In our discussion of constitutional interpretation, we will examine
    the Court's application of the Equal Protection Clause to racial
    segregation.

-   In the second half of the case, we will consider two broad sets of
    questions about the Equal Protection Clause in the context of
    sex/gender:

    -   Questions *internal to* the anticlassification approach: How did
        sex/gender end up receiving intermediate scrutiny? Should
        intermediate scrutiny apply to sex- or gender-based
        classifications? Does intermediate scrutiny have strong enough
        teeth? Or, is intermediate scrutiny too strict?

    -   Questions *about* the anticlassification approach: Is
        anticlassification sufficient for equal protection? Is it
        necessary?
