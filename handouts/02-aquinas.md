# Thomas Aquinas, Selections from *Summa Theologiae* I-II

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## Our Question

-   The grounds of legal validity: *In virtue of* what is a law valid?
    Or, what *makes* a law valid, or what *explains* the fact that a law
    is valid?
    -   *The Social Thesis*: A law is valid entirely in virtue of social
        facts (especially facts about how the law has come into being).
    
        -   While legal positivists accept the Social Thesis, natural
            law theorists deny it.
    
-   An Alternative Formulation: Are law and morally *conceptually
    separable*?

    -   *The Conceptual Separability Thesis*: As a conceptual matter, a
        law does not need to satisfy requirements of morality in order
        to be (legally) valid.

        -   While legal positivists accept the Conceptual Separability
            Thesis, natural law theorists deny it.

-   Aquinas' account of law provides a classic example of natural law
    theory.

## Aquinas' Account of Law as Ordinances of Reason

-   *Natural law*: Principles of reason, which can be discovered and
    understood by human beings through our natural faculty of reason.

-   *Human law*: Laws that are made by human beings. On Aquinas'
    account, there are three requirements that a human law needs to
    satisfy in order to have the force of law:
    -   First, Aquinas argues that human laws must follow the natural
        law because only principles of reason can have the force of
        law---in his words, only reason is "the rule and measure of
        human action." So, if a human-made rule has the force of law, it
        must have the force of law in virtue of being in some way
        derived from the natural law.
        -   According to Aquinas, a human law can be derived from the
            natural law in two ways---"as a conclusion from premises"
            and "by way of determination of certain generalities."
        
            -   *Principle of reason*: We should not put others in
                danger.
        
            -   *Conclusion from premises*: We should not drive too
                fast.
        
            -   *Determination of generalities*: The speed limit near a
                school should be 15 miles/hour.
        
        -   Worry: Human laws do not have to be derived from the natural
            law in order to have the force of law. "Whatever is pleasing
            to the prince has the force of law." (Indeed, if you don't
            obey it, the prince will enforce it!)
        
            -   Aquinas' Response: "The will \[of the prince\] . . .
                cannot command with the force of law unless it is first
                ruled by reason." If the will of the prince does not
                follow reason, it "would not be law but would be
                unjust."
        
        -   Aquinas claims that a human-made rule follows principles of
            reason when "it is ordered to the common good" and
            "impose\[s\] proportionate burdens" on those subject to the
            rule.
        
    -   Aquinas then argues that only "the whole population or . . . the
        public person who has the care of the whole population" can
        order things to the common good and so can make laws because the
        law is *coercive*. On the other hand, "a private person has no
        power to coerce behaviour."
    
    -   Finally, Aquinas argues that promulgation is necessary for a
        human law to have the force of law because it is the only way
        the human law can be *applied* to the people who are meant to be
        governed by it.
    
-   Taken together, on Aquinas' account, "\[L\]aw . . . is nothing other
    than an ordinance of reason for the sake of the common good,
    promulgated by the one who has the care of the community."

    -   What if a human law does not satisfy the requirements of reason?

        -   Aquinas: "\[I\]f in any point \[a human law\] deflects from
            the law of nature, it is no longer a law but a perversion of
            law." "The like are acts of violence rather than laws;
            because, as Augustine says . . ., 'a law that is not just,
            seems to be no law at all.'"

    -   Aquinas' account is representative of natural law theory:

        -   Denies the Social Thesis: The fact that a human law is law
            is grounded in part in the fact that its content satisfies
            the requirements of reason.

        -   Denies the Conceptual Separability Thesis: It is in the
            nature of law that it follows principles of reason.

## Objections to Aquinas' Account

-   *Diversity of human laws*: Principles of reason are supposed to be
    universal. If human laws are derived from principles of reason, then
    human laws should also be universal. On the contrary, human laws are
    very diverse.
    -   Aquinas' reply: There can be different but equally reasonable
        conclusions/determinations of the same principle of reason. For
        example, putting the speed limit at 10 miles/hour or 15
        miles/hour can both be compatible with the requirements of
        reason.
        -   Further worry: What about more fundamental disagreements
            about the law? For example, Oregon's Death with Dignity Act
            allows a terminally-ill patient with a life expectancy of
            less than six months to ask their physician to prescribe a
            medication that they can take to end their own life, whereas
            most other states prohibit it. This does not seem to be the
            kind of conclusions/determinations of principles of reason
            where reasonable minds can differ.
            -   Aquinas will have to say at least some of the states got
                it *wrong* in the case of euthanasia? Consider what he
                says about "the Germans": "It was said, for example,
                about the Germans, that they once did not regard piracy
                as a wrong, although it is expressly against the natural
                law."
    
-   *Validity of unjust laws*: If Aquinas' account is correct, then
    there *have never been* any laws that enforced slavery or racial
    segregation because an unjust law is no law at all. That implication
    is clearly absurd.

-   *Moral obligation to obey unjust laws*: Many philosophers think, at
    least in a legitimate liberal constitutional democracy, we sometimes
    have a moral obligation to obey an unjust law just because it is the
    law. For example, we might think the tax code is unjust because it
    disadvantages the worst off, but we still have a moral obligation to
    obey the tax code and pay our taxes.
    -   Aquinas' reply: An unjust law can still have authority over us
        if disobeying it can lead to "scandal or disturbance."
        -   Further worry: Too many things can lead to scandal or
            disturbance. Think again about laws that enforced
            slavery---they caused a war! Allowing such a broad exception
            would undermine the initial appeal of Aquinas' account.
