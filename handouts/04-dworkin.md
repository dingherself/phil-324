# Ronald Dworkin, “The Model of Rules”

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## Recap

-   Aquinas' natural law theory: "An unjust law is no law at all."

-   Austin's command-based legal positivism

    -   Mistake of classical natural law theory: It conflates what the
        law is and what the law ought to be. And to answer the question
        of what the law is, which is the proper subject matter of
        jurisprudence, we should look to social facts, not moral facts.
        -   *The Conceptual Separability Thesis*: As a conceptual matter
            at least, what the law is and what the law ought to be are
            two separable questions.
        
        -   *The Social Thesis*: It is entirely in virtue of social
            facts that a law is valid.
        
            -   Specifically, for Austin, the relevant social facts are
                facts about the law being a certain species of command.
    
-   Hart's rule-based legal positivism

    -   Austin's fundamental mistake: Command-based theories cannot
        capture a salient feature of the central case of law---the kind
        of normativity law exerts on those that fall under it, from the
        internal point of view.

    -   Hart argues that the central case of law is best understood
        instead as the union of primary and secondary rules.

-   Fuller's procedural natural law theory

    -   Fuller gives up on substantive moral conditions on legal validity.

    -   However, Fuller insists that there are certain procedural moral
        requirements that are internal to law.

## Dworkin on the Tenets of Legal Positivism

-   Dworkin claims that legal positivism is committed to three basic
    claims:
    1.  The law is a distinct set of rules: they are rules but
        distinguishable from other social rules that may be accepted by
        the community (rules of positive morality, rules of etiquette,
        etc.), and "can be identified and distinguished by . . . their
        *pedigree* or the manner in which they were adopted or
        developed" (emphasis in original).
    
    2.  Legal rules are exhaustive of the law: if a case is not covered
        by a legal rule, then a judge cannot decide it by applying the
        law (because there is none); rather, they must exercise their
        discretion in a way that goes beyond the law by *making a new
        rule* and applying it retroactively.
    
    3.  We have legal obligations entirely in virtue of legal rules: if
        there is no applicable legal rule in a case, there is no legal
        obligation; and when a judge exercises their discretion in a way
        that goes beyond the law, they are not enforcing any *legal*
        obligation (because now this obligation is imposed in part in
        virtue of something beyond the law).
    
-   Dworkin targets primarily the second tenet---the law consists of
    only legal rules.

    -   Hart is Dworkin's chief interlocutor in this paper, who defends
        a legal positivist account *par excellence*.

    -   Dworkin argues that Hart's legal positivism fails to account for
        legal *principles*.

## Legal Principles vs. Legal Rules

-   Dworkin argues that when judges decide cases, they consider not only
    legal rules but also legal principles (which, following Dworkin, we
    will just call "principles" for short).

-   Dworkin explains that we can talk about principles in a broad or a
    narrow sense.

    -   In the broad sense, principles include "principles \[in the
        narrow sense\], policies, and other sorts of standards."

    -   A policy is a "kind of standard that sets out a goal to be
        reached, generally an improvement in some economic, political,
        or social feature of the community."

        -   Dworkin's example is "automobile accidents are to be
            decreased."

    -   A principle in the narrow sense is "a standard that is to be
        observed, not because it will advance or secure an economic,
        political, or social situation deemed desirable, but because it
        is a requirement of justice or fairness or some other dimension
        of morality."

        -   Dworkin uses *Riggs v. Palmer* as an example. In that case,
            a grandson, who was named in his grandfather's will, murdered
            him in order to inherit his property. The court refused to
            let the grandson inherit even though the statutes said
            otherwise. The justification that the court relied on was
            the principle that no one shall profit from one's own wrong.

    -   When Dworkin claims Hart's theory fails to account for the role
        played by principles in the law, he means principles in the
        broad sense.

-   Dworkin thinks two features distinguish principles from *rules*:

    -   First, rules apply in an all-or-nothing manner in the following
        sense: either a rule doesn't apply, in which case it has nothing
        to do with the outcome of a case, or it applies and necessitates
        the outcome.

        -   Dworkin's example: "In baseball a rule provides that if the
            batter has had three strikes, he is out. An official cannot
            consistently acknowledge that this is an accurate statement
            of a baseball rule, and decide that a batter who has had
            three strikes is not out."

        -   Another example: California's 1994 "Three Strikes, You're
            Out" law requires a mandatory prison term of 25 years to
            life if someone with two previous serious or violent felony
            convictions is convicted of *any* new felony, even if the
            third felony is not serious and not violent. (In 2012,
            California voters approved a ballot measure to require the
            third felony also be serious or violent.)
            -   Here, the three strikes law is a rule because, if you
                get three strikes, you get 25 years to life.
            
        -   In contrast, principles provide reasons but not conclusive
            reasons for an outcome.
            -   For example, the First Amendment's protection of speech
                can be seen as a principle: in applicable cases, it
                provides a reason for an outcome, but does not
                necessitate the outcome (for example, incitement of
                imminent lawless action is not protected by the First
                Amendment under *Brandenburg v. Ohio*).
        
    -   Second, rules are not weighted, whereas principles are.

        -   If two rules conflict, they cannot both be valid.

            -   For example, if a rule says masks are required in
                university buildings and another rule says they are not,
                then one of them must be invalid.
    
        -   Two principles, on the other hand, can conflict and still
            both be valid. Indeed, in cases like this, the job of the
            judge is to balance the *weight* of one principle against
            that of the other.
    
            -   For example, religious freedom and equal protection can
                conflict. If we think religious freedom *trumps* equal
                protection in a case, it is because we consider
                religious freedom to be more *weighty* in that case, but
                that doesn't mean equal protection must be an invalid
                principle.
    
-   How might legal positivists try to accommodate the role played by
    principles in the law? Dworkin considers two strategies:

    1.  Legal positivists could treat legal principles the same way they
        treat legal rules: principles are part of the law.

        -   Implications:

            -   Principles are *legally* binding in the same way legal
                rules are.

            -   A judge who fails to take the relevant principles into
                account is in some way failing their *legal*
                responsibility.

            -   When a judge enforces a certain right or obligation by
                appealing to principles, they are enforcing a *legal*
                right or obligation.

    2.  Alternatively, legal positivists could take legal principles to
        be *extra*-legal, that is, *beyond* the law.

        -   Implications:

            -   Principles are not legally binding (because they are
                beyond the law).

            -   A judge who fails to take the relevant principles into
                account is not in some way failing their legal
                responsibility (again, because principles are beyond the
                law).

            -   When a judge enforces a certain right or obligation by
                appealing to principles, they are not enforcing a legal
                right or obligation (because principles are beyond the
                law).

-   Dworkin's aim is to show that neither strategy works, and so legal
    positivism must fail.

    -   This is an argumentative form called "constructive dilemma":

        -   Premise 1: Either A or B.

        -   Premise 2: If A, then C.

        -   Premise 3: If B, then C.

        -   Conclusion: Therefore, C.

    -   Here's an example:

        -   Premise 1: Either I had coffee in the morning, or I had tea
            in the morning.

        -   Premise 2: If I had coffee in the morning, I'll have ice
            cream in the afternoon.

        -   Premise 3: If I had tea in the morning, I'll have ice cream
            in the afternoon.

        -   Conclusion: Therefore, I'll have ice cream in the afternoon.

    -   We can reconstruct Dworkin's argument against legal positivism
        in the form of a constructive dilemma:

        -   Premise 1: Either legal positivists take principles to be
            part of the law, or they take principles to be beyond the
            law.

        -   Premise 2: If legal positivists take principles to be part
            of the law, legal positivism fails.

        -   Premise 3: If legal positivists take principles to be beyond
            the law, legal positivism fails.

        -   Conclusion: Therefore, legal positivism fails.

-   We can grant Dworkin Premise 1 for the sake of argument. The
    soundness of his argument then depends on whether Premises 2 and 3
    are both true.

## Three Senses of Judicial Discretion

-   Dworkin starts with the second strategy, that is, principles are not
    part of the law.

    -   This strategy is closely connected to legal positivists' view on
        judicial discretion: they think that, in a hard case where the
        law seems to "run out," the judge has to reach beyond the law
        and exercise their discretion by *making a new rule* from the
        bench and applying it retroactively to the case.

    -   Let's think about Hart's example of "No vehicle in the park."

        -   Imagine, however, someone rode their scooter into the park.
            Is a scooter a vehicle?

        -   For Hart, the law runs out here. The judge has to exercise
            discretion and make a new rule saying either scooters are or
            are not allowed in the park and apply the rule retroactively
            to the case.

-   Dworkin thinks we should distinguish three importantly different
    senses in which someone may exercise discretion. The first two of
    the three are weak discretion, and the last one strong.
    1.  *Discretion as use of judgment*: "\[T\]he standards an official
        must apply cannot be applied mechanically but demand the use of
        judgment."
        -   Dworkin's Example: "Take your five most experienced soldiers
            on patrol."
        
        -   The sergeant has discretion in carrying out the order in the
            sense that they must use their judgment and decide who are
            the five most experienced soldiers they have.
        
    2.  *Discretion as finality*: "\[S\]ome official has final authority
        to make a decision and cannot be reviewed and reversed by any
        other official."
        -   Something like: "You will have the final say as to who are
            the five most experienced soldiers."
        
        -   The sergeant has discretion in the sense that their judgment
            is final and not reviewable.
        
    3.  *Discretion as absence of standards set by authority*: The
        official "is simply not bound by standards set by the authority
        in question."
        -   This, however, does not imply the absence of *any*
            standards: "certain standards of rationality, fairness, and
            effectiveness" can still apply.
        
        -   It is specifically the absence of standards *set by the
            relevant authority that grants the discretion*.
    
-   In a short paragraph, Dworkin quickly dismisses the second sense
    (finality) as irrelevant to the question of how to account for legal
    principles. It's not clear what the argument is. But it's probably
    not what legal positivists mean when they talk about discretion
    anyway.
    -   So, the choice is between the first sense and the third sense.
    
    -   Dworkin notes that this choice parallels that of the two
        strategies for accounting for principles. Indeed, it seems the
        two strategies each logically entail one of the two senses of
        discretion:
        -   If legal principles are part of the law, then a judge's
            exercise of discretion by appealing to principles is bound
            by the law (because principles are part of the law). So,
            they exercise discretion in the first sense: using their
            judgment in applying the principles, which are standards
            within the law.
        
        -   If, instead, legal principles are beyond the law, then when
            a judge appeals to principles (which are beyond the law),
            they exercise discretion in a way that is not bound
            standards set by the relevant authority that gives them the
            power of discretion (again, because principles, on this
            view, are standards beyond the law).
    
-   In light of this, we can flesh out Dworkin's argument as follows:

    -   Premise 1: Either legal positivists take principles to be part
        of the law, or they take principles to be beyond the law.

    -   Premise 2: If legal positivists take principles to be part of
        the law, then they take judges to exercise discretion in the
        first sense (use of judgment).

    -   Premise 3: If legal positivists take judges to exercise
        discretion in the first sense (use of judgment), then legal
        positivism fails.

    -   Premise 4: If legal positivists take principles to be beyond the
        law, then they take judges to exercise discretion in the third
        sense (absence of standards set by authority).

    -   Premise 5: If legal positivists take judges to exercise
        discretion in the third sense (absence of standards set by
        authority), then legal positivism fails.

    -   Conclusion: Therefore, legal positivism fails.

-   Our assessment of Dworkin's argument now turns on Premises 3 and 5.

## Discretion as Absence of Standards Set by Authority?

-   Dworkin offers a complicated argument for Premise 5.

    -   First, legal positivists have no successful argument for their
        claim that principles are not legally binding. And since judges
        exercise discretion in the strong sense (absence of standards
        set by authority) only if principles are not legally binding
        (they are beyond the law), legal positivists have no successful
        argument for their claim that judges exercise strong discretion.

    -   Second, there is also an independent argument *against* the
        claim that judges exercise strong discretion.

    -   Taken together, legal positivists' theory of judicial discretion
        is at best "unsupported."

-   Three unsuccessful legal positivist arguments against principles as
    binding
    -   *Argument from category mistake*: Principles are not legally
        binding because, logically speaking, principles just *cannot* be
        legally binding.
        -   Essentially, it's like saying "apples are legally binding."
            It makes no sense.
        
            -   Instead, principles might be binding *morally* (in the
                same way a moral principle is binding),
                *institutionally* (something like there being a special
                obligation judges have because they are public
                officials), and/or *professionally* (a special obligation
                judges have because they are legal professionals).
        
        -   Dworkin's worry: Just look at *Riggs*. If the court were to
            fail to consider the principle that no one shall profit from
            their own wrong, the court would make not only a moral,
            institutional, or professional mistake but also a *legal*
            mistake.
        
    -   *Argument from conclusiveness*: Principles are not legally
        binding because they are not dispositive.
        -   Dworkin's worry: Don't be misled by the word "binding."
            Something can be legally binding even if it does not dictate
            the outcome of a case.
        
    -   *Argument from controversiality*: Principles are not legally
        binding because they are controversial.
        -   Unlike legal rules, whose validity can always be traced back
            to an act of Congress or something like that, "\[t\]here is
            no litmus paper for testing" the validity of principles.
        
            -   As a result, we can only *argue for* the validity of a
                principle, but others might disagree with us.
        
        -   Dworkin's worry: Think about the sergeant who was order to
            pick their five most experienced soldiers. There is likewise
            "no litmus paper for experience," but that does not mean the
            sergeant suddenly has strong discretion in a way that's not
            bound by the standards set by their superior.
    
-   An independent argument for principles as binding

    -   Dworkin argues that at least some principles have to be legally
        binding because otherwise no legal rules can be legally binding
        either.
        -   Dworkin's example: Consider the principle of *stare
            decisis,* which discourages courts from overturning
            precedents even if they may be wrong. If *stare decisis* is
            not legally binding, then nothing prevents courts from
            radically reshaping the existing legal landscape at will.
        
        -   A possible worry: Dworkin is just describing how *stare
            decisis* really is---to use a legal term of art---"for
            suckers."[^1]
            -   As an example, consider Justice Thomas' famous
                concurring opinion in *Gamble v. United States* (2019),
                where he stated his view on *stare decisis*: "In my
                view, the Court's typical formulation of the *stare
                decisis* standard does not comport with our judicial
                duty under Article III because it elevates demonstrably
                erroneous decisions---meaning decisions outside the
                realm of permissible interpretation---over the text of
                the Constitution and other duly enacted federal law."
                (\*2)
            
            -   So, on Thomas' view, the usual understanding of *stare
                decisis* is not only not legally binding, but
                contradicts "our judicial duty under Article III" of the
                Constitution. The Court should overturn precedents,
                according to Thomas, as long as they are "demonstrably
                erroneous."
            
            -   When are precedents demonstrably erroneous? Thomas gives
                us some helpful examples in his concurrence in *Ramos v.
                Louisiana* (2020): "Due process incorporation is a
                demonstrably erroneous interpretation of the Fourteenth
                Amendment. . . . The unreasonableness of this
                interpretation is underscored by the Court's many
                incorrect decisions based on this theory, see
                *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U. S. 644 (2015); *Roe v.
                Wade*, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); *Dred Scott v. Sandford*,
                19 How. 393 (1857)."
            
            -   Given legal positivists characteristically think
                questions about what the law is is conceptually prior to
                questions about what the law ought to be, we should not
                think principles such as *stare decisis* already *are*
                legally binding even if perhaps they *ought to* be.
    
-   But let's grant Dworkin all these points for now. Suppose Dworkin is
    right that we should not think (or at least have no good reason to
    think) judges have strong discretion, then can legal positivists
    weaken their position and say instead judges have only weak
    discretion in the first sense (use of judgment)?
    -   That's the other horn of the constructive dilemma.

## Discretion as Use of Judgment?

-   Dworkin argues that if legal positivists reject strong judicial
    discretion, they may have to give up all three of their tenets.

    -   To start with, rejecting strong judicial discretion amounts to
        rejecting the second legal positivist tenet: Rejecting strong
        judicial discretion means principles are legally binding and are
        part of the law. Thus, legal rules are not exhaustive of the
        law.

    -   Next, consider the first tenet, which concerns in part the
        grounds of legal validity:
        -   Dworkin notes, "The origin of . . . legal principles lies
            not in a particular decision of some legislature or court,
            but in a sense of appropriateness developed in the
            profession and the public over time. Their continued power
            depends upon this sense of appropriateness being sustained."
        
        -   In other words, unlike legal rules, the validity of legal
            principles is grounded in some (ultimate) rule of
            recognition.
        
        -   But the first tenet says the law is a distinct set of rules
            (now add principles as well) which can be distinguished from
            other social rules/principles and these distinct
            rules/principles can be identified and distinguished by
            certain facts about their pedigree.
        
    -   Finally, allowing principles to be part of the law means there
        can be legal obligations even if there are no applicable legal
        rules (because they can instead be applicable legal principles).
    
        -   The third tenet denies that.
    
-   Altogether, Dworkin's argument against legal positivism is as
    follows:

    -   Premise 1: Either legal positivists take principles to be part
        of the law, or they take principles to be beyond the law.

    -   Premise 2: If legal positivists take principles to be part of
        the law, then they take judges to exercise discretion in the
        first sense (use of judgment).

    -   Premise 3: If legal positivists take judges to exercise
        discretion in the first sense (use of judgment), then legal
        positivism fails because doing so contradicts all of its three
        tenets.

    -   Premise 4: If legal positivists take principles to be beyond the
        law, then they take judges to exercise discretion in the third
        sense (absence of standards set by authority).

    -   Premise 5: If legal positivists take judges to exercise
        discretion in the first sense (use of judgment), then legal
        positivism fails because there is no good reason to think judges
        exercise discretion in the third sense (absence of standards set
        by authority).

    -   Conclusion: Therefore, legal positivism fails.

## Final Worry: Is Anyone a Legal Positivist on Dworkin's Account?

-   If anyone is a legal positivist, Dworkin surely takes Hart to be one
    (indeed, Hart is the legal positivist *par excellence*).

    -   But it's not obvious that Hart would actually buy any of the
        three tenets Dworkin attributes to legal positivism.

-   The first tenet turns out to contain two importantly different
    theses:

    -   *The Distinctiveness Thesis*: The law is distinct from other
        social standards such as rules of etiquette or rules of positive
        morality.

        -   Hart probably believes something like this.

    -   *The Pedigree Thesis*: Legal rules can be identified and
        distinguished by their pedigree.

        -   Hart is *not* committed to that.

        -   Hart might say things like legal rules can be identified and
            distinguished by their being recognized as passing all the
            tests set out in the rule of recognition. But, very
            importantly, Hart does *not* say these tests must be tests
            of pedigree.
            -   Indeed, nothing prevents the rule of recognition from
                including a test based on Dworkin's "sense of
                appropriateness developed in the profession and the
                public over time" which Dworkin thinks grounds the
                validity of principles.
        
    -   So, Hart does not accept the first tenet.
    
-   The second tenet can be understood in terms of the following thesis:

    -   *The Exhaustiveness Thesis*: Legal rules are exhaustive of the
        law.

        -   For Dworkin, rules do not include principles.

        -   However, it's not obvious that Hart uses "rules" in a way
            that excludes principles.

        -   We can try to make them speak to each other by
            distinguishing two interpretations of the Exhaustiveness
            Thesis:
            -   *The Exhaustiveness Thesis (Interpreted Exclusively)*:
                Legal rules (in Dworkin's sense, that is, excluding
                principles) alone are exhaustive of the law.
            
            -   *The Exhaustiveness Thesis (Interpreted Inclusively)*:
                Legal rules (in Dworkin's sense, that is, excluding
                principles) *and legal principles* are collectively
                exhaustive of the law.
            
        -   Dworkin's argument against legal positivism works only if we
            interpret the Exhaustiveness Thesis exclusively, but it's at
            best not apparent that's how Hart would read the
            Exhaustiveness Thesis.
        
    -   So, there seems to be no justification for thinking Hart accepts
        the second tenet *in Dworkin's sense*.
    
-   The third tenet:

    -   *The Right/Obligation Thesis*: If there is no applicable legal
        rule in a case, there is no legal obligation, and when a judge
        exercises their discretion to enforce a right or obligation in
        that case, they are not enforcing any *legal* right or
        obligation.

    -   This seems to misconstrue Hart's view. For Hart, when a judge
        confronts a hard case where the law runs out, the judge makes a
        new (legal) rule and applies it *retroactively* to the case. So,
        the judge *is* enforcing a legal right or obligation. It's just
        that this legal right or obligation is created later.

        -   A natural worry: Isn't retroactive law-making unjust?

            -   Hart: "The reason for regarding retrospective law-making
                as unjust is that it disappoints the justified
                expectations of those who, in acting, have relied on the
                assumption that the legal consequences of their acts
                will be determined by the known state of the law
                established at the time of their acts. This objection,
                however, even if it has force against a court's
                retrospective change or overruling of clearly
                established law, seems quite irrelevant in hard cases
                since these are cases which the law has left
                incompletely regulated and where there is no known state
                of clear established law to justify expectations."

            -   Think also about Fuller's internal morality of law: Even
                for Fuller, what's concerning is the *abuse* of
                retroactive law-making.

    -   So, it turns out Hart does not accept the third tenet, either.

-   Collectively, the worry is, even if Dworkin has a sound argument, it
    is only against a *strawman*---a caricature of legal positivism that
    is not accepted by Hart (our legal positivist *par excellence*) or
    worst by any legal positivist.
