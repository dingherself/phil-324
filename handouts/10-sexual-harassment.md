## The Sexual Harassment of Working Women

-   MacKinnon's analysis of sexual harassment: "Sexual harassment, most
    broadly defined, refers to the unwanted imposition of sexual
    requirements in the context of a relationship of unequal power."
    -   For MacKinnon, sexual harassment is not inappropriate yet
        harmless flirting; rather, it is, at bottom, an abuse of social
        *power* expressed in a *sexual* form.
        -   This is a point worth poring over. As MacKinnon sees it,
            both elements, that is, power and sexuality, are essential
            to what sexual harassment really *is*: an exercise of social
            *power* in, through, and as *sexuality*.
        
    -   Specifically, MacKinnon argues that sexual harassment is the
        social subordination of *women* sexualized and even eroticized.
    
        -   For MacKinnon, sexuality cuts deep into reality of women's
            second-class status, social disadvantages and powerlessness:
            while to be a man is to be a *human* being, to be a woman is
            to be a *sexual* being.
    
        -   Importantly, MacKinnon argues, sexuality itself is not
            innocuous but *unequal*. What it *means* to be a woman in a
            society like ours is in part constituted by a certain sort
            of sexuality (indeed, a certain sort of
            *hetero*sexuality)---*the female sex* whose task is to be
            sexually pleasing, sexually inviting, sexually accessible,
            sexually subservient, all *to men*. What is involved here is
            a (hetero)sexual mode of *objectification*: women are
            socially defined and created to be sexual objects for men's
            use and pleasure.
    
            -   MacKinnon quotes a sex worker: "\[My first trick\]
                wasn't traumatic because my training had been how to be
                a hustler anyway. I learned it from the society around
                me, just as a woman. We're taught how to hustle, how to
                attract, hold a man, and give sexual favors in return. .
                . . It's a market place transaction. . . . the most
                important thing in life is the way men feel about you. .
                . . It's not too far removed from what most American
                women do---which is to put on a big smile and act. . . .
                What I did was no different from what ninety-nine per
                cent of American women are taught to do."
    
        -   The centrality of sexuality to women as a sex becomes the
            source of women's social worth *as women*, but it is
            simultaneously stigmatized, cornering women into an
            impossible double-bind. As MacKinnon puts it,
    
            -   "Women learn early to be afraid that men will not be
                attracted to them, for they will then have no future;
                they also learn early to be afraid that men will be
                attracted to them, for they may then also have no
                future."
    
        -   This imposed social understanding of women as *sexual*
            objects---perhaps, even as *sex itself*---is also
            inescapable: to be a woman is for one's very presence, very
            being to be inherently sexually provocative, even in
            situations where the woman occupies a relative position of
            power. MacKinnon's discussion of *Dothard v.
            Rawlinson* (1977) is helpful here:
    
            -   One of the questions the Court considered in *Dothard*
                was a rule of the Alabama Board of Corrections that
                women could not work in inmate contact positions in a
                male penitentiary.
    
            -   The *Dothard* Court held that the rule did not violate
                Title VII: "A woman's relative ability to maintain order
                in a male, maximum-security, unclassified penitentiary
                of the type Alabama now runs could be directly reduced
                *by her womanhood*. There is a basis in fact for
                expecting that sex offenders who have criminally
                assaulted women in the past would be moved to do so
                again if access to women were established within the
                prison. There would also be a real risk that other
                inmates, deprived of a normal heterosexual environment,
                would assault women guards *because they were women*."
                (emphasis added)
    
            -   In a sharp dissent, Justice Marshall calls out the
                elephant in the room: "In short, the \[majority's\]
                fundamental justification for the decision is that women
                as guards will generate sexual assaults. With all
                respect, this rationale regrettably perpetuates one of
                the most insidious of the old myths about women---that
                women, wittingly or not, are seductive sexual objects.
                The effect of the decision, made I am sure with the best
                of intentions, is to punish women because their very
                presence might provoke sexual assaults."
    
            -   The majority's solution to the problem of male inmates
                sexually assaulting female guards, of course, is not to
                do something about the male inmates but to protect the
                women out of their jobs. MacKinnon asks, "Sexual
                harassment of women prison guards by male prisoners
                became the reason they should not occupy the job at all.
                If the extent of sexual assault in all kinds of jobs
                were known, would women be banished from the workplace
                entirely?"
    
-   Two implications of MacKinnon's conception of sexual harassment are
    particularly worth pointing out:

    -   To begin with, on MacKinnon's account, sexuality is not only
        inseparable from but in part constitutive of the social meaning
        of sex/gender.

        -   C.f. Justice Alito's *Bostock* dissent: "Discrimination
            because of sexual orientation is different. It cannot be
            regarded as a form of sex discrimination . . . since
            discrimination because of sexual orientation is not
            historically tied to a project that aims to subjugate either
            men or women. An employer who discriminates on this ground
            might be called 'homophobic' or 'transphobic,' \[sic\] but
            not sexist."

        -   To quote MacKinnon slightly out of context here: "Given the
            institution of heterosexuality, does one believe this?"

        -   Oops, surprise! Justice Alito certainly believes it. Justice
            Thomas, who joined Justice Alito's dissent in full, seems to
            believe it too.

    -   Another implication of MacKinnon's conception is that men cannot
        be sexually harassed the same way women are sexually harassed
        (with one exception, I think---more on this shortly).

        -   The reason is this: for MacKinnon, to be sexually harassed
            is not *simply* being leered at, having one's body commented
            on or touched "accidentally," being visually undressed,
            being propositioned, etc., but to occupy a certain position
            in a power dynamic---the position of being imposed unwanted
            sexual advances *because one is the powerless* in this power
            dynamic, the position of a forced choice (implicit or
            explicit) between unwanted sexual advances and adverse
            consequences (in one's employment, education, etc.)

        -   Again, according to MacKinnon, sexual harassment is wrongful
            because it is an abuse, an exploitation of unequal social
            power cashed out in a sexual form.

            -   Of course, the averse consequences themselves are
                wrongful. But even if the powerless person complies with
                or tolerates the unwanted sexual advances and gets the
                promised benefit (which they often don't), this person
                is still wronged just by being put into the position of
                a forced choice alone.

            -   It's like blackmail: you comply, you get the promised
                benefit (or avoidance of adverse consequences), but you
                are still wronged.

        -   Both positions in this unequal power dynamic---the powerful
            and the powerless---are *social*, not biological, positions.
            For MacKinnon, the powerful position is, by social
            definition, the man's position, whereas the powerless the
            woman's.
            -   Crucially, on (one leading interpretation of)
                MacKinnon's view, to be a woman/man is not to have a
                female-typed/male-typed body, or even to have a
                female/male gender/sex(ual) identity, but to occupy a
                subordinate/privileged social position, regardless of
                one's body or identity.
            
            -   Of course, there is a deep connection especially between
                one's body and the social position one occupies.
                However, the connection is not between one's social
                position and one's body *per se* (something biological),
                but more accurately between one's social position and
                the *social meaning* of one's body (something *social*).
                It is the social meaning of bodies, rather than bodies
                themselves (the flesh/blood/bones), that is unequal. It
                is the social meaning of one's body that places one in a
                subordinate or privileged social position.
            
            -   In specific power dynamics, it's then possible for
                someone female-bodied to occupy a man's social
                position---to "*function*\[\] socially as if she were a
                man" (emphasis added). MacKinnon explains, "\[I\]f a
                woman professor or corporate executive sexually harasses
                male students or workplace subordinates, she should not
                escape liability because she is a woman. She has
                succeeded to the forms of power which traditionally have
                been the province of men, and has attained the
                protection and legitimacy of such a male-defined
                position. She derives the power to insist from those
                structures that traditionally have sanctioned men's
                demands. She has also succeeded to that aspect of sex
                role that has been peculiarly male cultural behavior:
                the imposition of unwanted sex upon the less powerful.
                If she is in a position to make sexual demands with
                relative impunity, as men have been, and uses that
                position to play the sex role men have played, she
                should succeed to the legal liability men in positions
                of power incur for abusive sexual practices. If nothing
                else, such an argument should demonstrate that the
                determinants of sexual behavior are not so much
                biological as deeply social. The rarity of such
                instances demonstrates how deep the social determinants
                go. But the woman who functions socially as if she were
                a man should be viewed by the law according to the
                social power she wields, regardless of body."
            
            -   MacKinnon does not say this explicitly, but it seems
                that it must also be possible for a man to be sexually
                harassed *as if he were a woman*---to take on the social
                meaning of a woman's body and to occupy a woman's social
                position, despite his body. Hence, the exception I
                mentioned earlier: in this context, he is sexually
                harassed the same way a woman is sexually harassed
                because he is *functionally* a woman.
    
-   But so far we haven't even addressed the book's full title: sexual
    harassment of *working* women.

    -   MacKinnon's focus is the sexual harassment of women specifically
        *in employment*.

        -   MacKinnon's proffered reason is that employment is one of
            the few contexts where women's equality is legally promised
            (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).

        -   Additionally, it seems that the sexual harassment of women
            at work provides an especially analytically rich case study
            that sheds light on women's inequality at large.

            -   In the work context, women's *material* inequality and
                *sexual* inequality converge in a way that makes women
                especially vulnerable to exploitation---the exploitation
                of women as *women workers*.

    -   More specifically, on MacKinnon's account, sexual harassment at
        work is wrongful because it "places the woman in the position of
        having to choose between tolerating or complying with sexual
        demands on the one hand and suffering employment deprivation on
        the other."

        -   Note again that, while the employment deprivation or other
            adverse employment consequences are certainly themselves
            wrongful, one can be wronged by sexual harassment just in
            virtue of the very fact that one is forced to make a choice,
            regardless of whether one complies with it.

        -   As MacKinnon puts it, sexual harassment at work is
            "economically enforced sexual exploitation."

            -   The economic and the sexual elements are mutually
                reinforcing: "Working women are defined, and survive by
                defining themselves, as sexually accessible and
                economically exploitable. Because they are economically
                vulnerable, they are sexually exposed; because they must
                be sexually accessible, they are always economically at
                risk."

        -   Notably, the problem is not individual moral failings on the
            part of a few bad apples who happen to be in a position of
            power. It is not the exceptional, but the regular, the
            normal.

            -   The problem is not incidental and isolated, but
                *structural* and *systematic*: it does not just happen
                to be the case that being sexually harassed is such a
                common experience among women but not so much among men;
                rather, it is *because* one is a woman that one is
                targeted for sexual harassment.

-   MacKinnon divides sexual harassment at work into two categories,
    which courts later adopted:
    -   *Quid pro quo*: the more or less explicit exchange of sexual
        compliance for employment benefit.
        -   There are three major types of quid pro quo sexual
            harassment, which all follow the standard pattern: sexual
            advance---compliance or resistance---employment consequence.
            (Please bear with me: I'm bad at naming things.)
        
            -   *Resist*: sexual advance---resistance---employment
                retaliation.
        
            -   *Renege*: sexual advance---compliance---no employment
                benefit.
        
            -   *Recompense*: sexual advance---compliance---employment
                benefit.
        
        -   The Resist cases are analytically easiest as they present
            the clearest case of an employment injury within the purview
            of antidiscrimination law.
        
        -   The Renege cases seem more difficult at first sight: If the
            woman complies, is it still sexual harassment, still
            *unwanted* sexual advance?
        
            -   MacKinnon argues this obscures the wrong of sexual
                harassment: "Whether or not the woman complies, the
                crucial issue is whether she was sexually coerced by
                economic threats or promises. Requiring her to decline
                would allow the employer to impose such a deal in bad
                faith, secure sexual favors, and then assert she had no
                right to complain because she had done what he had no
                right to demand. Her compliance does not mean it is not
                still blackmail."
        
            -   Still, MacKinnon thinks the woman in the Renege case
                should not be allowed to recover the promised employment
                benefit for pragmatic, policy reasons: "\[Doing so\]
                would support women in refusing unwanted sex, and
                discourage abuse of the cause of action through attempts
                to get whatever could be gained through sexual
                compliance and reserving legal resort for times when it
                did not work out."
        
        -   One might take Recompense cases to be counterexamples to the
            claim that sexual harassment disadvantages women. Instead,
            as the skeptics would put it, "sleeping one's way to the
            top" is an *unfair* advantage that women have over men.
            -   This objection, according to MacKinnon, fundamentally
                misconstrues the reality of women's inequality: "Rather
                than deriving unfair advantages because of their sex,
                perhaps they had to meet unfair requirements because of
                their sex. In this perspective, the woman who 'slept her
                way to the top' may have been the woman who would not
                have been hired or promoted, regardless of
                qualifications, without fulfilling sexual conditions,
                conditions equally qualified men do not have to fulfill.
                Moreover, for every woman who 'got her degree on her
                back,' there were men who offered rewards, supervision,
                and attention to her development only at a sexual price.
                To the extent they are true, then, these stories
                document a point seldom made: men with the power to
                affect women's careers allow sexual factors to make a
                difference. So the threats are serious: those who do not
                comply are disadvantaged in favor of those who do. (It
                is also seldom considered that a woman might be an
                attractive sexual object to her superior for the same
                reasons that *qualify* her for the position.)" (emphasis
                in original)
            
            -   But there's also the elephant in the room: given how
                sexist and misogynistic our society is, it is also
                doubtful how many of such stories are indeed true and
                how many are made up to dismiss a woman's success. In
                this respect, the way women are pictured as having the
                unfair sex advantage of an "easy" route is itself
                indicative of, rather than exonerates, the sexualization
                of women's subordination. As MacKinnon puts it
                elegantly, "These stories may exemplify a
                well-documented inability of both sexes to see women in
                any but sexual terms. Willingness to believe the stories
                may illustrate the pervasive assumption that, since a
                career is so intrinsically inappropriate for a woman,
                her sexuality must define her role in this context, as
                well as in all others. This dovetails with the prior
                assumption that if a woman's sexuality is present at
                all, she must be receiving unfair consideration."
        
    -   *Condition of work*: A second type of sexual harassment at work
        occurs not in the form of a sexual advance sugar-coated with a
        promised benefit and backed by threat of retaliation, but as a
        *condition of women's work*---regularly being leered at, being
        commented on, being "accidentally" touched, etc., such that they
        become a feature of a woman's working condition and indeed a job
        requirement, which she has to put up with or else leave.
        -   Even though compliance/noncompliance characterizes sexual
            harassment as quid pro quo, what's at play in sexual
            harassment as a condition of work is the *appearance* of
            women's compliance---to tolerate it, to play along with it,
            while carefully "walk\[ing\] very thin lines between
            preserving their own sanity and self-respect and often
            severe material hardship and dislocation."
        
        -   MacKinnon explains, "Since communicated resistance means
            that the woman ceases to fill the implicit job
            qualifications, women learn, with their socialization to
            perform wifelike tasks, ways to avoid to open refusals that
            anger men and produce repercussions. This requires 'playing
            along,' constant vigilance, skillful obsequiousness, and an
            ability to project the implication that there is a sexual
            dimension to, or sexual possibilities, for, the
            relationship, while avoiding the explicit 'how about it'
            that would force a refusal into the open."
        
        -   MacKinnon quotes a cocktail waitress: "\[A waitress\] must
            learn to be sexually inviting at the same time that she is
            unavailable. . . . She must manage to turn him off gently
            without insulting him, without appearing insulted. Indeed
            she must appear charmed by it, find a way to say no which
            also flatters him."
        
        -   While there is no explicit quid pro quo in condition of work
            cases, it is the same deal: the sexual exploitation of their
            economic insecurity.

-   The remaining question is why sexual harassment in employment
    constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights
    Act of 1964.

    -   Recall that Title VII prohibits employment discrimination
        "because of . . . race, color, religion, sex, or national
        origin."

    -   We encounter *that* question again: Given the text of Title VII
        does not seem to prohibit employment discrimination because of
        sexual harassment or because of sexuality, why does it prohibit
        sexual harassment in employment?

    -   MacKinnon argues that both the difference approach and the
        dominance approach support an affirmative answer.

## Sexual Harassment as Sex Discrimination: The Difference Argument

-   According to the difference approach, the mandate of
    antidiscrimination is that similarly situated persons must be
    treated the same.

-   Here, we encounter the first major hurdle: for sexual harassment to
    be discrimination on the basis of sex, men must be *capable* of
    being sexually harassed so women and men can be similarly situated.

    -   The danger is getting the pregnancy result: if men are not
        capable of being sexually harassed, then there is a real
        difference between the sexes, and so there is no sex
        discrimination.

    -   MacKinnon argues sexual harassment can be distinguished from
        pregnancy to avoid the absurd result.

        -   First, MacKinnon identifies the discriminatory element in
            sexual harassment as discrimination on the basis of
            *sexuality*.

        -   Second, MacKinnon argues that while pregnancy is *unique but
            not universal* to women, sexuality is *universal but not
            unique* to women.

            -   The difference is critical: women and men can be
                similarly treated when it comes to sexual harassment
                because men *can* also be sexually harassed.

-   But we just cleared the first hurdle. Now enter the standard but-for
    test: sexual harassment is sex discriminatory if and only if women
    would not be sexually harassed *but for* their sex, that is, if and
    only if similarly situated men *are not* sexually harassed.

    -   This limits the types of sexual harassment that the difference
        approach can recognize as sex discriminatory: if men *are*
        sexually harassed, then women are not treated differently than
        similarly situated men, and so there is no sex discrimination.

    -   A loophole emerges: what if an employer sexually harasses women
        *and* men employees?

        -   There is still some room for maneuver if the employer
            sexually harasses both women and men employees, but
            *disproportionately*.

        -   However, consider a *perfect equal opportunity bisexual
            harasser*, who harasses both women and men employees
            perfectly proportionately.

            -   The difference approach entails that there is no sex
                discrimination.

            -   MacKinnon calls this the "bisexual defense."

## Sexual Harassment as Sex Discrimination: The Dominance/Inequality Argument

-   The dominance approach starts by examining what it means to prohibit
    discrimination because of *sex*.
    -   The difference approach thinks there is nothing to be examined:
        to prohibit discrimination because of sex is just to prohibit
        discrimination because of . . . sex! Males and females, basic
        biology!
        -   But that is a factual mistake. To talk simply in terms of
            "sex" is at best ambiguous. MacKinnon distinguishes three
            meanings: are we talking about discrimination on the basis
            of *physical characteristics*, on the basis of *gender
            identification*, or on the basis of *sex roles*?
            -   While the three may coincide especially in the case of a
                cisheterosexual person, they need not. And it's a
                mistake of fact to think the three are identical just
                because they happen to coincide in the case of a
                cisheterosexual person.
            
            -   Once one realizes the three are distinct, one soon
                realizes that physical characteristics cannot by
                themselves determine gender identification or sex roles.
            
            -   Another realization is that even sex-typed physical
                characteristics themselves are not rigidly oppositional,
                but exist along a spectrum.
            
        -   There is, however, also an analytical mistake: the mistake
            of thinking the meaning of "sex" that is relevant to
            antidiscrimination is the biological meaning.
        
            -   What places women in a subordinate social position and
                justifies women's so being socially subordinated is not
                any plain biological difference, but the *social
                meaning* attributed to a female body.
        
            -   Consider an analogous distinction between the color of
                one's skin and the social meaning attributed to the skin
                color. Black people are not marked socially as inferior
                because they have black skin color, but because skin
                color has *social meaning*. As MacKinnon puts it, "In
                both cases---race, where the law should be clear by now,
                and sex, where it has been muddied by reproductive
                biology---it is the social meaning attributed to the
                differences that is at stake and determines the social
                position of the group, not the differences themselves.
                Thus, when blacks were considered biologically inferior,
                it was the social meaning attributed to their biology
                that made it so. Similarly, when women are considered
                inferior, it is the social meaning of their biology that
                makes it so."
        
            -   Such social meaning is not only *imposed* onto our
                bodies through institutionalized sexing, but it is also
                *unjustified*: there is nothing inherent in a person's
                having a penis or a vulva that can justify them
                occupying a privileged or subordinate position.
        
    -   According to the dominance approach, then, protections against
        discrimination because of sex, properly understood, are
        protections against discrimination because of the *social
        meaning* of sex. And such protections are needed because the
        social meaning of sex is not just different, but *unequal*.
    
        -   Sexual harassment is an expression of the social meaning of
            having a female-typed body (or being presumed or even
            imagined to have a female-typed body). It is a central
            dimension of women's structural and systematic social
            subordination. As such, it is sex discriminatory.
    
        -   In the employment context, sexual harassment becomes a
            violation of Title VII because it constitutes sex-based
            employment discrimination---the sexual exploitation of
            women's structural and systematic economic disadvantage.
    
-   Even though the dominance approach agrees with the difference
    approach that sexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination, the
    two approaches produce importantly different reasons for why this is
    so. Let's consider this specifically in the employment context:

    -   *The difference approach*: Sexual harassment constitutes
        sex-based employment discrimination in violation of Title VII
        because female workers are treated *differently* than similarly
        situated male workers because they are females.
        -   Here, following a standard convention in analytic feminist
            philosophy, I'm using the terms "female" and "male" as sex
            terms.
        
    -   *The dominance approach*: Sexual harassment constitutes
        sex-based employment discrimination in violation of Title VII
        because sexual harassment structurally and systematically
        *disadvantages* women because they are women.
    
        -   Here, I'm using the term "women" to refer to the social
            meaning of sex, not sex itself.
    
-   The case of the perfect equal opportunity harasser provides the
    clearest test case for the two approaches in the context of sexual
    harassment at work:

    -   The difference approach finds no sex discrimination because male
        and female workers are equally sexually harassed.

    -   The dominance approach still finds sex discrimination because
        perfect equal opportunity sexual harassment still works to
        women's detriment given the unequal social meaning assigned to
        their sexed bodies. Women and men do not suddenly become social
        equals just because they are equally sexually harassed.
