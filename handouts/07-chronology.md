# Women’s Liberation Movement and the Law: A Chronology of Cases

NB: This chronology has been a work-in-progress. Please let me know if you spot errors or omissions. Even though they are not explicitly cited here, I could not have put this together without consulting similar chronologies included in [Kristan Poirot’s dissertation](https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/poirot_kristan_a_200408_phd.pdf) and [Ruth Rosen’s *The World Split Open*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/332271/the-world-split-open-by-ruth-rosen/), as well as [Amy Leigh Campbell’s paper on the history of the ACLU Women's Rights Project](https://www.aclu.org/other/raising-bar-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-aclu-womens-rights-projectthe-texas-journal-women-law-157).

## Women’s Liberation Movement

### 1967

At the National Conference for New Politics in Chicago, a resolution written by the women’s caucus (which was organized by Shulamith Firestone and Jo Freeman) was refused consideration before the full conference; Firestone, in particular, was publicly humiliated by a conference organizer as he patted on her head and called her a “little girl” who just needed to “cool down”

In the aftermath, Firestone and Freeman started the Westside group in Chicago, one of the first women’s liberation groups in the United States

Many other women’s liberation groups also began to emerge across the country; the most prominent among them was New York Radical Women (NYRW), a group Firestone co-founded after she moved to New York

### 1968

Under Freeman’s editorship, *Voice of the Women’s Liberation Movement* began national publication in January

NYRW published [*Notes from the First Year*](https://repository.duke.edu/dc/wlmpc/wlmms01037)

*Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham* (striking down the Birmingham ordinance implicated in *Walker* as facially unconstitutional)

NOW’s New York Chapter picketed *New York Times* in protest of the newspaper’s practice of segregating job ads by sex

The [Fall 1968 issue of *Lilith*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/community.28039456) published a powerful letter by the Sisters of the Black Women’s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon, New York, in which the Sisters defended economically disadvantaged Black women who used birth control pills from accusations that they were contributing to their own genocide

NYRW led a [**“No More Miss America” protest**](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-no-more-miss-america-announced-a-feminist-upheaval/) in Atlantic City on September 7, creating a national media moment in which the famous “bra-burning feminist” trope emerged (even though by all accounts no bras were actually burned at the protest!)

A groundbreaking Gender Dysphoria Program was started at Stanford University Medical School

Word spread that Friedan spoke of lesbians as a kind of “lavender menace” that risked sabotaging the very cause of women’s liberation

**California passed a law to allow no-fault divorce, becoming the first state to do so**

Founding of the Chicago Women’s Liberation Union (CWLU)

### 1970

NOW’s first lesbian purge: Rita Mae Brown, newsletter editor of NOW’s New York Chapter, resigned publicly along with two colleagues in protest of the “enormous prejudice . . . directed against the lesbian”[^abbottwomen1971] from NOW’s leadership locally and nationally; later, Ivy Bottini, president of NOW’s New York Chapter, was forced by the national executive board to withdraw an amendment that would add “sexual privacy” to NOW’s Bill of Rights document because the board did not want to go on record voting for or against it; at the same meeting, Dolores Alexander, NOW’s national executive director, was ousted for crossing Friedan and also for fear that she might be a lesbian (even though she considered herself straight at the time)

[^abbottwomen1971]: Quoted in Sidney Abbott and Barbara Love, “Is Women’s Liberation a Lesbian Plot?,” in *Woman in Sexist Society: Studies in Power and Powerlessness*, ed. Vivian Gornick and Barbara K. Moran (New York: Basic Books, 1971), p. 446.

Friedan was quoted publicly for saying lesbians were the “lavender menace” in a March 15 article [“Sisterhood Is Powerful”](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/15/archives/sisterhood-is-powerful-a-member-of-the-womens-liberation-movement.html) by Susan Brownmiller in *New York Times Magazine*

At the Second Congress to Unite Women on May 1, a group of lesbian feminists (who would later call themselves the “Radicalesbians”) in their “LAVENDER MENACE” T-shirts [took control of the stage](https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/lavender-menace-action-at-second-congress-to-unite-women/), distributed a position paper titled “The Woman Identified Woman,” and talked candidly with the audience about lesbian issues

NOW led a nationwide Women’s Strike for Equality on August 26

[*Notes from the Second Year*](https://repository.duke.edu/dc/wlmpc/wlmms01039), edited by Firestone and associate-edited by Anne Koedt

Kate Millett’s *Sexual Politics* appeared over the summer; later that year, Millett was forced to come out as lesbian at a panel discussion after being pushed hard by a member of Radicalesbians in the audience; but, on December 14, [a *Time* magazine article](https://time.com/vault/issue/1970-12-14/page/68/) outed Millett as bisexual and used her sexuality as a weapon to attack her and the women’s liberation movement; soon after, at a rally organized by the Women’s Strike Coalition, a group of feminists distributed lavender armbands to show solidarity with Millett, although Friedan reportedly threw her armband to the ground and resigned from the coalition

Reed*** (holding that a state law mandating preference for males over females for appointment as administrator of an estate violates the Equal Protection Clause), marking the first time the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down a statute on the grounds that it was sex discriminatory

Judith Jarvis Thomson’s now-classic “A Defense of Abortion” appeared in the first issue of *Philosophy and Public Affairs*

*New York Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers; soon, the federal government successfully sought an injunction in federal court to prevent the *Times* from continuing to publish the Papers; the baton was then picked up by *Washington Post*, and so the government once again sought, albeit without success in the lower courts this time, an injunction against the *Post*; within days, both cases were before the U.S. Supreme Court; in an extraordinary proceeding, the Court vacated the injunction in *New York Times v. United States* and affirmed the denial of injunction in *United States v. Washington Post*
