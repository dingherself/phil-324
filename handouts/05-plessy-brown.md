## Background: Test Cases

-   Civil rights lawyers pioneered a novel approach to legal change:
    intentionally violating a law and bringing it as a *test case* for
    the validity of the law.
    -   The goal is to get the court to strike down the law by giving
        the court an opportunity to do so and persuading the court to
        take the opportunity.
    
    -   Test cases are cherry-picked: the right plaintiff, the right
        facts, the right legal argument, and even the right court have
        to align.
    
        -   Sometimes, even the name of the plaintiff is selected
            carefully.
    
            -   In a recent (though not a civil rights case) case
                testing the validity of the mandatory contraceptive
                coverage provision under the Affordable Care Act, the
                plaintiff was a religious organization called "Little
                Sisters of the Poor."
    
-   Both *Plessy* and *Brown* were test cases that sought to challenge
    racial segregation laws, but *Plessy* famously backfired.

## *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896)

-   In 1890, Louisiana passed a statute which provided in part:

    -   "\[A\]ll railway companies carrying passengers in their coaches
        in this State shall provide equal but separate accommodations
        for the white and colored races by providing two or more
        passenger coaches for each passenger train, or by dividing the
        passenger coaches by a partition so as to secure separate
        accommodations. . . . No person or persons, shall be admitted to
        occupy seats in coaches other than the ones assigned to them on
        account of the race they belong to."

    -   "\[T\]he officers of such passenger trains shall have power and
        are hereby required to assign each passenger to the coach or
        compartment used for the race to which such passenger belongs;
        any passenger insisting on going into a coach or compartment to
        which by race he does not belong shall be liable to a fine of
        twenty-five dollars, or in lieu thereof to imprisonment for a
        period of not more than twenty days in the parish prison."

-   The plaintiff, Homer Plessy, was selected importantly because he was
    of seven-eighths Caucasian and one-eighth African descent and passed
    as white. He took a seat in the white-only coach, informed the
    railway officer that he was Black, and was ordered to move to a
    coach for Black passengers. Plessy refused to comply, and was
    arrested and charged under the Louisiana statute.

-   Plessy argues that the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional on 13th
    and 14th Amendments grounds.

-   The Court disagrees, holding the Louisiana statute is consistent
    with the requirements of both 13th and 14th Amendments.

    -   The Court dismisses the 13th Amendment challenge out of hand,
        and even expresses confusion as to why Plessy would even think
        there can be any 13th Amendment violation.

        -   "A statute which implies merely a legal distinction between
            the white and colored races---a distinction which is founded
            in the color of the two races, and which must always exist
            so long as white men are distinguished from the other race
            by color---has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of
            the two races, or reestablish a state of involuntary
            servitude. Indeed, we do not understand that the Thirteenth
            Amendment is strenuously relied upon by the plaintiff in
            error in this connection."

    -   As for the 14th Amendment challenge, the Court can see how the
        case implicates equality before the law, but cannot find the
        statute invalid.

        -   The Court acknowledges that "\[t\]he object of the \[14th\]
            amendment was undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality
            of the two races before the law."

        -   But the Court distinguishes *social* equality and
            *political* equality: "\[The 14th Amendment\] could not have
            been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or
            to enforce social, as distinguished from political,
            equality."

            -   Most relevantly, social inequality does not by itself
                entail political inequality, and so state legislatures
                can enact social segregation laws: "Laws permitting, and
                even requiring, their separation in places where they
                are liable to be brought into contact do not necessarily
                imply the inferiority of either race to the other, and
                have been generally, if not universally, recognized as
                within the competency of the state legislatures in the
                exercise of their police power."

            -   The Court cites as an example of this legitimate
                legislative power the racial segregation in D.C. schools
                *required* by Congress.

        -   Importantly, the Court reasons, if Black people think racial
            segregation "stamps" them "with a badge of inferiority,"
            that's really their problem:

            -   "If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in
                the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to
                put that construction upon it. The argument necessarily
                assumes that if, as has been more than once the case,
                and is not unlikely to be so again, the colored race
                should become the dominant power in the state
                legislature, and should enact a law in precisely similar
                terms, it would thereby relegate the white race to an
                inferior position. We imagine that the white race, at
                least, would not acquiesce in this assumption."

        -   In addition, the Court claims the law is not the solution to
            *social* inequality:

            -   "The argument also assumes that social prejudices may be
                overcome by legislation, and that equal rights cannot be
                secured to the negro except by an enforced commingling
                of the two races. We cannot accept this proposition. If
                the two races are to meet upon terms of social equality,
                it must be the result of natural affinities, a mutual
                appreciation of each other's merits and a voluntary
                consent of individuals."

        -   These two claims seem to create an interlocking double-bind
            for Black people, which the Court notices but does not find
            problematic:

            -   "Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts
                or to abolish distinctions based upon physical
                differences, and the attempt to do so can only result in
                accentuating the difficulties of the present situation.
                If the civil and political rights of both races be equal
                one cannot be inferior to the other civilly or
                politically. If one race be inferior to the other
                socially, the Constitution of the United States cannot
                put them upon the same plane."

        -   At the end of the day, the Court takes the legal question to
            come down to whether the Louisiana law was "reasonable."

            -   "In determining the question of reasonableness \[the
                Louisiana legislature\] is at liberty to act with
                reference to the established usages, customs and
                traditions of the people, and with a view to the
                promotion of their comfort, and the preservation of the
                public peace and good order. Gauged by this standard, we
                cannot say that a law which authorizes or even requires
                the separation of the two races in public conveyances is
                unreasonable, or more obnoxious to the Fourteenth
                Amendment than the acts of Congress requiring separate
                schools for colored children in the District of
                Columbia, the constitutionality of which does not seem
                to have been questioned, or the corresponding acts of
                state legislatures."

-   Justice Harlan is the lone dissenter.

    -   Harlan starts with a discussion of the inconveniences the
        Louisiana statute would cause white people:

        -   "A white man is not permitted to have his colored servant
            with him in the same coach, even if his condition of health
            requires the constant, personal assistance of such servant.
            If a colored maid insists upon riding in the same coach with
            a white woman whom she has been employed to serve, and who
            may need her personal attention while travelling, she is
            subject to be fined or imprisoned for such an exhibition of
            zeal in the discharge of duty."

    -   Harlan understands the point of the 13th and 14th Amendments
        very differently compared to the majority:

        -   "These two amendments, if enforced according to their true
            intent and meaning, will protect all the civil rights that
            pertain to freedom and citizenship."

    -   For Harlan, what's at issue here is "a state enactment that
        compels, under penalties, the separation of the two races in
        railroad passenger coaches, and makes it a crime for a citizen
        of either race to enter a coach that has been assigned to
        citizens of the other race."

        -   This is unacceptable, according to Harlan, because the
            Constitution is supposed to be color-blind:

            -   "In respect of civil rights, common to all citizens, the
                Constitution of the United States does not, I think,
                permit any public authority to know the race of those
                entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of such
                rights."

        -   But at times he seems to conflate the idea that the
            Constitution is color-blind and the idea that the
            Constitution tolerates no second-class citizenship:

            -   "But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law,
                there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling
                class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our
                Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor
                tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil
                rights, all citizens are equal before the law."

            -   This point is important, because it's conceivable that a
                statute can be color-*conscious* in a way that does not
                create classes among citizens---for example, by
                rectifying historical racial injustices.

        -   It seems what's really doing the work for Harlan is the
            anti-caste idea:

            -   "What can more certainly arouse race hate, what more
                certainly create and perpetuate a feeling of distrust
                between these races, than state enactments, which, in
                fact, proceed on the ground that colored citizens are so
                inferior and degraded that they cannot be allowed to sit
                in public coaches occupied by white citizens? That, as
                all will admit, is the real meaning of such legislation
                as was enacted in Louisiana."

        -   Harlan then responds to the objection that, since the
            Louisiana statute applied equally to both a Black person
            taking a seat in a white-only coach *and* a white person
            taking a seat in a Black-only coach, it cannot possibly
            create different classes among citizens.

            -   "But this argument does not meet the difficulty. Every
                one knows that the statute in question had its origin in
                the purpose, not so much to exclude white persons from
                railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored
                people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white
                persons. Railroad corporations of Louisiana did not make
                discrimination among whites in the matter of
                accommodation for travellers. The thing to accomplish
                was, under the guise of giving equal accommodation for
                whites and blacks, to compel the latter to keep to
                themselves while travelling in railroad passenger
                coaches. No one would be so wanting in candor as to
                assert the contrary."

            -   No one? Well\...

    -   Harlan also appears to make a further argument based on Black
        and white people's affinity or "destinies":
        -   "The destinies of the two races, in this country, are
            indissolubly linked together, and the interests of both
            require that the common government of all shall not permit
            the seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of
            law."
        
        -   This is unlike, notably, "the Chinese race": "There is a
            race so different from our own that we do not permit those
            belonging to it to become citizens of the United States.
            Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely
            excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race."
        
        -   But even Chinese passengers, who are "so different from our
            own," seem to sit above Black passengers! Can you even
            imagine how unfair that is to Black people: "But by the
            statute in question, a Chinaman can ride in the same
            passenger coach with white citizens of the United States,
            while citizens of the black race in Louisiana, many of whom,
            perhaps, risked their lives for the preservation of the
            Union, . . . are yet declared to be criminals, liable to
            imprisonment, if they ride in a public coach occupied by
            citizens of the white race."
        
    -   Harlan concludes with an explicit reference to slavery:
    
        -   "I am of opinion that the statute of Louisiana is
            inconsistent with the personal liberty of citizens, white
            and black, in that State, and hostile to both the spirit and
            letter of the Constitution of the United States. If laws of
            like character should be enacted in the several States of
            the Union, the effect would be in the highest degree
            mischievous. Slavery, as an institution tolerated by law
            would, it is true, have disappeared from our country, but
            there would remain a power in the States, by sinister
            legislation, to interfere with the full enjoyment of the
            blessings of freedom; to regulate civil rights, common to
            all citizens, upon the basis of race; and to place in a
            condition of legal inferiority a large body of American
            citizens, now constituting a part of the political community
            called the People of the United States, for whom, and by
            whom through representatives, our government is
            administered. Such a system is inconsistent with the
            guarantee given by the Constitution to each State of a
            republican form of government, and may be stricken down by
            Congressional action, or by the courts in the discharge of
            their solemn duty to maintain the supreme law of the land,
            anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the
            contrary notwithstanding."

## *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954)

-   In *Brown*, the Court explicitly considers whether the "separate but
    equal" doctrine established by *Plessy* is consistent with the 14th
    Amendment, specifically the Equal Protection Clause.
    -   Unlike prior cases, *Brown* and its companion cases challenge
        the "separate but equal" doctrine head-on: The segregated
        schools are equal in all tangible respects (such as facilities,
        teachers and curricula), but the plaintiffs argue they are still
        unequal.
    
    -   In other words, the question for *Brown* is whether the racial
        segregation in public schools is *inherently* or *per se*
        unequal, regardless of whether tangible factors merely
        associated with racial segregation are equal.
    
-   The Court holds that it is not.

    -   The Court cites several psychological studies, including a
        famous doll study by Kenneth and Mamie Clark, to conclude that
        "\[t\]o separate \[Black children\] from others of similar age
        and qualifications solely because of their race generates a
        feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that
        may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be
        undone."

    -   We should, I think, distinguish two interpretations of the
        *Brown* Court's argument:

        -   *The psychological reading*: Racial segregation in public
            schools is inherently unequal because it generates a
            permanent psychological feeling of inferiority in Black
            children.

        -   *The subordination reading*: Racial segregation in public
            schools is inherently unequal because it creates, reinforces
            or at least perpetuates the subordination of Black people.
            -   The subordination reading is stronger than the
                psychological reading: the permanent psychological
                feeling of inferiority is an effect of racial
                subordination, but it is not the whole story.
        
    -   The psychological reading is probably the more apparent reading
        of *Brown*.
        -   But the worry is that it is too weak for establishing the
            claim that racial segregation in public schools is
            *inherently* unequal: to make that claim, the Court has to
            say the connection between racial segregation in public
            schools and the permanent psychological feeling of
            inferiority is not merely accidental, but they are linked in
            a deeper way.
            -   It seems what generates the permanent psychological
                feeling of inferiority is not the *mere separation* of
                races. It's instead that this separation means something
                *given* the realities of racial domination and
                subordination. Put another way, racial subordination
                gives meaning to racial segregation, by means of which
                Black children *get the message* and learn that they are
                inferior.
            
        -   Even though the subordination reading may seem less obvious
            at first, it explicitly acknowledges racial segregation as
            not just contingently or accidentally connected to racial
            domination and subordination, but a symptom and perhaps an
            implementation mechanism of it.
            -   This would allow the Court to produce a direct rebuttal
                of the *Plessy* Court's claim that the mere fact of
                social segregation did not necessarily stamp Black
                people with a badge of inferiority.
            
            -   On this reading, the *Plessy* Court was wrong because it
                failed to connect racial segregation with racial
                domination and subordination (specifically with white
                supremacy).
            
        -   Indeed, I want to make the strong claim that the
            subordination reading is at least as natural as the
            psychological reading.
            -   Consider, again, how the *Plessy* Court dismissed the
                petitioner's objection based on the badge of
                inferiority: "We consider the underlying fallacy of the
                plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that
                the enforced separation of the two races stamps the
                colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so,
                it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but
                solely because the colored race chooses to put that
                construction upon it."
            
            -   The *Plessy* Court simply could not see how racial
                segregation could even implicate the inferiority of one
                race to another. If Black people think it does, it can
                only be because they misunderstand the point of
                segregation---"the promotion of . . . comfort, and the
                preservation of the public peace and good order," not
                racial domination/subordination.
            
            -   It's natural to think the reason the *Brown* Court cites
                psychological findings that Black children do experience
                a permanent feeling of inferiority is to use these
                findings as *evidence* for the reality of the badge of
                inferiority (racial subordination) that the *Plessy*
                Court failed to see.
            
            -   Still, the direct reason that racial segregation in public
                schools violates equal protection is that racial
                segregation stamps Black children with a badge of
                inferiority (it is an instrument of racial domination),
                not *just* that it causes the permanent psychological

## When Did Racial Segregation in Public Schools Start to Be Unconstitutional?

-   There is a further philosophical question about when racial
    segregation in public schools started to be unconstitutional---a
    question about what the law is. *Prima facie*, there are three
    possible answers:
    1.  Racial segregation in public schools *had never been*
        constitutional since the enactment of the 14th Amendment, even
        before *Brown* was decided.
    
    2.  Racial segregation in public schools *became* unconstitutional
        (the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause changed)
        sometime after *Plessy* and before *Brown*.
    
        -   So, the *Plessy* Court and the *Brown* Court were both
            correct about what the Equal Protection Clause required.
    
    3.  Racial segregation in public schools was *made* unconstitutional
        by *Brown*.
    
-   A natural law theorist would probably give the first answer.

    -   The worry is the inability to account for the validity of unjust
        laws.

-   The second answer owes us an explanation of how racial segregation
    could become unconstitutional in the absence of a court ruling to
    that effect. The most obvious explanation probably has to do with
    positive morality: public opinion about what the Equal Protection
    Clause requires has changed over time.

    -   But this is unsatisfying because we can't say *Plessy* was
        wrongly decided---the public opinion at the time of *Plessy*
        most likely didn't think racial segregation in public schools
        violated the Equal Protection Clause, and the Court held so
        accordingly.

-   The third answer could be read in two ways:

    1.  The *Brown* Court repealed the rule established by *Plessy*,
        enacted a new rule, and applied the new rule retroactively to the
        case.
    -   This is a Austinian positivist understanding of the
            relationship between *Plessy* and *Brown*?
        
    -   It raises the same worry: We don't just want to say *Brown*
            changed the law. We also want to say in some significant
            sense *Brown* was correct and *Plessy* mistaken about the
            law.
        
2.  The *Brown* Court revered *Plessy* because *Plessy* was wrongly
        decided, and *Brown* gave the *right* interpretation of the
        Equal Protection Clause.
    
    -   But what is the right interpretation of a law? Is there even
            such a thing? If so, how can we know what it is?
    
    -   For that, we need a theory of constitutional interpretation.
