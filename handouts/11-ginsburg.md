## What is Reproductive Autonomy an Issue of?

-   Ginsburg begins by observing that questions of gender-based
    classifications and questions of reproductive autonomy are
    *understood* very differently by the Court:

    -   Gender-based classifications are understood doctrinally to be an
        issue of *discrimination against women*.

    -   Reproductive autonomy, in contrast, is treated doctrinally as an
        issue of *substantive due process* in a way "not expressly
        linked to discrimination against women."

-   Ginsburg also notes that the Court has *proceeded* very differently
    in these cases:

    -   In approaching gender-based classifications, the Court has been
        *cautious*, favoring *incremental* steps.

    -   In approaching reproductive autonomy, the Court has been *bold*,
        favoring *sweeping* steps.

        -   This, for Ginsburg, is a pragmatic mistake: "*Roe* ventured
            too far in the change it ordered. The sweep and detail of
            the opinion stimulated the mobilization of a right-to-life
            movement and an attendant reaction in Congress and state
            legislatures." The symbolic power of *Roe* prompted the
            federal government and states to find creative ways to
            "minimiz\[e\] the impact of the 1973 rulings \[*Roe* and its
            companion case *Doe*\], including notification and consent
            requirements, prescriptions for the protection of fetal
            life, and bans on public expenditures for poor women's
            abortions." (footnotes omitted)

        -   What should have *Roe* done, then? Ginsburg seems to think
            it should have stopped at striking down the Texas statute
            without announcing the trimester framework and the viability
            doctrine.

-   But Ginsburg has a more substantive critique of *Roe* as well---"the
    Court presented an incomplete justification for its action."

    -   Ginsburg argues that, in *Roe*'s conception of the right to
        abortion, there is always the *physician* in the background.
        That is, the kind of privacy or autonomy *Roe* appeals to is a
        more or less medicalized form of autonomy---autonomy conceived
        in a patient-physician relationship. The right to abortion that
        *Roe* recognizes, Ginsburg thinks, is really the right of a
        patient to make a decision in consultation with a physician.

    -   This way, even if we add the woman back into the picture, the
        role that gender plays in the right to abortion is really the
        role of biology. Women are relevant to the right to abortion
        only insofar as they have the "right" bodies to participate in
        the kind of patient-physician relationship at issue in abortion.

    -   But that medical, biological conception of reproductive autonomy
        is fundamentally inadequate, Ginsburg argues: "It is not a
        sufficient answer to charge it all to women's anatomy---a
        natural, not man-made, phenomenon. Society, not anatomy, 'places
        a greater stigma on unmarried women who become pregnant than on
        the men who father their children.' Society expects, but nature
        does not command, that 'women take the major responsibility. . .
        for child care' and that they will stay with their children,
        bearing nurture and support burdens alone, when fathers deny
        paternity or otherwise refuse to provide care or financial
        support for unwanted offspring." (footnotes omitted)

    -   For Ginsburg, an unfortunate consequence of the medical,
        biological conception of reproductive autonomy is that it
        misconstrues what is even at stake in abortion: "The conflict .
        . . is not simply one between a fetus' interests and a woman's
        interests, narrowly conceived, nor is the overriding issue state
        versus private control of a woman's body for a span of nine
        months. Also in the balance is a woman's autonomous charge of
        her full life's course---as Professor Karst put it, her ability
        to stand in relation to man, society, and the state as an
        independent, self-sustaining, equal citizen."

    -   The medical, biological conception of reproductive autonomy,
        Ginsburg argues, has misled the Court in cases that concern the
        public funding of abortion services.

        -   Citing *McRae*, Ginsburg writes, "the Court found no
            constitutional infirmity in the Hyde Amendment, which
            excluded even medically necessary abortions from Medicaid
            coverage. After these decisions, the Court was accused of
            sensitivity only to the Justices' own social milieu\--'of
            creating a middle-class right to abortion.' "

        -   A right to abortion without guarantee of the necessary
            financial resources to make that decision not only
            disproportionately but in an important sense *distinctively*
            harms women who---surprise!---lack the financial resources.

            -   This is because, as Ginsburg points out, even before
                *Roe* "women of means could end their pregnancies by
                traveling to states or foreign nations with less
                restrictive abortion laws."

            -   Presumably, this would hold true even if *Roe* were to
                be overruled: certain states and countries would never
                outlaw abortion, and relatively affluent women will
                almost always have access to abortion services just by
                traveling.

            -   This way, reproductive autonomy is evidently an issue of
                gender *equality*. And had the Court viewed it as an
                issue of gender inequality, Ginsburg writes, the Court
                might have reached a different conclusion.

## Question to Think about

-   How might reproductive autonomy be recognized doctrinally as an
    issue of gender equality?

    -   It's not obvious that it is possible under the Court's current
        gender equality jurisprudence, which follows the difference
        approach. We talked about this dilemma before:

        -   The Court can either be cissexist and think pregnancy is
            unique to women. That means it is a real biological
            difference that makes women different but equal. Questions
            about discrimination simply cannot arise as a conceptual
            matter.

        -   Or, the Court can be sensitive to the fact that not only
            women can get pregnant. The problem then is there would not
            be discrimination as long as the law denies abortion funding
            for *everyone*.

        -   Either way, it seems recognizing reproductive autonomy as an
            issue of gender equality is extremely difficult if not
            impossible under the difference approach.

    -   The dominance approach has little trouble conceptualizing
        reproductive autonomy as an issue of *women*'s equality because
        it disadvantages women on the basis of the social meaning of
        their sexed bodies, contributing to their structural and
        systematic social subordination.

        -   But the problem, again, is that reproductive autonomy is a
            broader gender equality issue than *women*'s equality---not
            just women need access to abortion services.
