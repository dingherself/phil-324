# Reproductive Freedom Cases

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## Background: The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment

-   The 14th Amendment again:

    -   "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and
        subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United
        States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make
        or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
        immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state
        deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
        process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
        the equal protection of the laws."

-   If you asked someone random, which of the clauses of the 14th
    Amendment they thought the textual home of the right to abortion
    was, they'd probably say the Privileges or Immunities Clause.

    -   However, in the *Slaughterhouse Cases* (1873), the Court
        narrowly construed the Privileges or Immunities Clause as
        covering only the privilege or immunities of citizens of the
        United States *as citizens of the United States*, such as the
        right of "a citizen of the United States \[to\], of his own
        volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a *bona
        fide* residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens
        of that State."

    -   This narrow construction effectively gutted the Privileges or
        Immunities Clause.

-   As a result, the Court has turned to the Due Process Clause as the
    textual home for rights not enumerated in the Constitution.

    -   The Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause as protecting
        not only procedural rights, but also *substantive* rights
        covered under the term "liberty"---a doctrine known as
        *substantive due process*.

    -   For example, we already discussed *Loving v. Virginia*. While we
        focused on the equal protection issue, the *Loving* Court also
        gave a substantive due process argument: the right to marry is
        fundamental to the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause
        such that a state cannot deprive an interracial couple of this
        right with a miscegenation law.

-   However, not all liberty interests receive the same level of
    protection under the Due Process Clause.

    -   The Court has recognized certain liberty interests as
        *fundamental*. Like suspect classifications under the Equal
        Protection Clause, fundamental rights trigger *strict scrutiny*:
        statutes that infringe on fundamental rights must be *narrowly
        tailored* to serve a *compelling* state interest.

    -   Statutes that restrict other liberty interests---*mere* liberty
        interests---are reviewed under *rational basis review*: they
        must be *rationally related* to a *legitimate* state interest.

## Roadmap

-   This lecture will introduce you to the law side of things. In this
    next lecture, we will consider an important critique of the Court's
    reproductive freedom jurisprudence.

-   Here is the major line of cases we will discuss in this lecture:

    -   *Roe v. Wade* (1973) (and its companion case, *Doe v. Bolton*)

    -   *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992)

    -   *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt* (2016)

    -   *June Medical Services v. Russo* (2020)

-   I want you to draw, in your head, a line dividing the cases into two
    groups:

    -   The first group: *Roe* and *Casey*

    -   The second group: *Whole Woman's Health* and *June Medical*

-   The first group of cases:

    -   *Roe*, of course, is the most well-known case on reproductive
        freedom.

    -   However, the current leading precedent is not *Roe* but *Casey*.

        -   Even though *Casey* affirmed *Roe* in name, it severely
            gutted *Roe* in substance.

        -   While *Roe* would apply strict scrutiny to abortion
            restrictions, *Casey* applies a more lenient "undue burden"
            test.

    -   I will call the *Roe* and *Casey* series of cases the
        *traditional* cases, because they understand the justification
        of antiabortion legislation in the traditional way---in terms of
        the state's interest in protecting the "potential life" of the
        unborn fetus.

-   The second group of cases:

    -   Unlike the traditional cases, the more recent cases present a
        different kind of justification for abortion regulations: not in
        terms of a state interest in the potential life of the unborn
        fetus, but in terms of a state interest in the *protection of
        women's health*. These more recent laws are known as "TRAP
        laws"---targeted regulation of abortion providers. As the name
        makes clear, TRAP laws target *abortion clinics*---the point is
        to subject abortion clinics to medically unnecessary regulatory
        standards that they cannot meet, thereby forcing abortion
        clinics to shut down.

        -   *Note on terminology*: Throughout these two lectures, I will
            follow the Court's practice of talking in terms of "pregnant
            woman," "mother" and "women's health." This is, needless to
            say, factually mistaken. Not all people who need access to
            abortion services are women.

        -   The reason I'm using the Court's terminology is I want to
            present it as it is. The terminology raises a nontrivial
            question that I don't want to presuppose an answer to: If
            the Court's reproductive freedom jurisprudence is based in
            part on a cissexist conception of sex/gender, what does it
            mean for those who need access to abortion services but are
            not women? Do they have a right to abortion? Do they
            exercise that right as their own genders, or only as women?
            These are questions never considered by the Court.

-   While these four cases concern the permissibility of laws directly
    regulating abortion and abortion clinics, another issue we will
    discuss (in the next lecture) is the *public funding* of abortion
    services.

    -   Since 1976, Congress has attached various versions of the Hyde
        Amendment to appropriations bills, preventing the use of federal
        Medicaid funds for abortion services, with very limited
        exceptions (in recent years: life-endangering conditions, rape
        and incest)

    -   In *Harris v. McRae* (1980), the Court upheld the
        constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment on the grounds that the
        right to abortion is only a negative right *from* governmental
        regulations, not a positive right that entitles those seeking
        abortions to the financial resources necessary to make this
        decision. The *McRae* Court also held that the Hyde Amendment
        should not be subjected to strict scrutiny because poverty is
        not a suspect classification.

        -   The *McRae* Court reasons, "\[I\]t simply does not follow
            \[from *Roe*'s ruling\] that a woman's freedom of choice
            carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the
            financial resources to avail herself of the full range of
            protected choices. . . . \[A\]lthough government may not
            place obstacles in the path of a woman's exercise of her
            freedom of choice, it need not remove those not of its own
            creation. Indigency falls in the latter category. The
            financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman's
            ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally
            protected freedom of choice are the product not of
            governmental restrictions on access to abortions, but rather
            of her indigency."

## *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965)

-   *Griswold* concerned a Connecticut statute which prohibited the use
    of "any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of
    preventing conception."
    -   Estelle Griswold was executive director of Planned Parenthood of
        Connecticut, and C. Lee Buxton was medical director of a Planned
        Parenthood birth control clinic in New Haven, Connecticut. They
        prescribed contraceptives to *married* women. But they were
        arrested and found guilty as accessories under the Connecticut
        statute. The state appeals court and the state supreme court
        affirmed.
    
-   *Held*: The Connecticut statute is unconstitutional because it
    violates a married heterosexual couple's right to privacy.

    -   The significance of *Griswold* is the recognition that the
        Constitution protects the right to privacy.

    -   The Court realizes the Constitution never explicitly mentions
        the right to privacy, but holds that this right can---and,
        indeed, *must*---be implied by various provisions of the
        Constitution.

        -   As the Court puts it, "\[S\]pecific guarantees in the Bill
            of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those
            guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various
            guarantees create zones of privacy."

        -   Using the First Amendment as an example, the Court explains,
            "The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only
            the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute,
            the right to receive, the right to read and freedom of
            inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach---indeed
            the freedom of the entire university community. Without
            those peripheral rights the specific rights would be less
            secure."

        -   The Connecticut statute infringes on a married heterosexual
            couple's freedom to use contraceptives, which the Court
            holds is squarely within the zone of marital privacy implied
            by the Constitution.

## *Roe v. Wade* (1973)

-   The Texas statute that was challenged in *Roe* criminalized
    abortions unless they were "procured or attempted by medical advice
    for the purpose of saving the life of the mother."

-   *Held*: The Texas statute is unconstitutional.

    -   In *Roe*, the Court relies on *Griswold* to recognize that "a
        woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy" is a
        fundamental right protected by the Constitution.

    -   The Court therefore subjects the Texas statute to strict
        scrutiny: to survive strict scrutiny, it must be narrowly tailed
        to serve a *compelling* state interest.

    -   The Court recognizes two state interests in regulating abortion:

        -   To protect the pregnant woman's health; and

        -   To protect "the potentiality of human life."

    -   The Court then examines when each interest becomes compelling:

        -   The point when the state interest in protecting the pregnant
            woman's health becomes compelling is "at approximately the
            end of the first trimester."

        -   The point when the state interest in protecting the
            potential life becomes compelling is "at viability" (that
            is, the point when the fetus is capable of surviving outside
            the uterus) because the fetus at this point "presumably has
            the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's
            womb."

    -   This comes to be known as the "trimester framework":

        -   "For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first
            trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must
            be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's
            attending physician."

        -   "For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the
            first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the
            health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the
            abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to
            maternal health."

        -   "For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in
            promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life
            may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion
            except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical
            judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the
            mother."

## *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992)

-   At issue in *Casey* were five provisions of the Pennsylvania
    Abortion Control Act of 1982 (The first four are exempted in the
    event of a statutorily defined "medical emergency"):

    1.  *Content-based counseling*: A woman seeking an abortion is
        required to be given certain information prior to the procedure,
        including, *inter alia*:
        -   "The \[Pennsylvania\] department \[of health\] publishes
            printed materials which describe the unborn child and list
            agencies which offer alternatives to abortion and that she
            has a right to review the printed materials and that a copy
            will be provided to her free of charge if she chooses to
            review it."
        
        -   "Medical Assistance benefits may be available for prenatal
            care, childbirth and neonatal care, and that more detailed
            information on the availability of such assistance is
            contained in the printed materials published by the
            department."
        
        -   "The father of the unborn child is liable to assist in the
            support of her child, even in instances where he has offered
            to pay for the abortion. In the case of rape, this
            information may be omitted."
        
    2.  *24-hour waiting period*: The statutorily mandated information
        must be given to the woman at least 24 hours in advance of the
        procedure.
    
    3.  *Parental consent for minors*: A minor seeking an abortion must
        obtain the informed consent of one of her parents, although they
        are also allowed to petition a court for judicial authorization
        to have the abortion.
    
    4.  *Husband notification for married women*: A married woman
        seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she
        has notified her husband that she is going to have an abortion,
        unless certain exceptions apply.
    
    5.  *Reporting*: An abortion provider must file a report with the
        state for every abortion it performs, disclosing to the state,
        *inter alia*:
        -   The name of the physician who performed the abortion.
        
        -   The name of the physician who referred the woman for
            abortion.
        
        -   "Whether the abortion was performed upon a married woman
            and, if so, whether notice to her spouse was given. If no
            notice to her spouse was given, the report shall also
            indicate the reason for failure to provide notice."
    
-   The district court struck down all five provisions as
    unconstitutional. The court of appeals reversed in part, striking
    down only the husband notification requirement and upholding the
    rest.

-   In *Casey*, the Court is explicitly asked to reconsider and overrule
    *Roe*.

    -   A 5--4 majority votes to reaffirm "the essential holding of
        *Roe v. Wade*."

    -   However, the Court fails to agree on what standard of review to
        apply.

-   A three-justice plurality rejects the strict scrutiny test and
    applies instead an "undue burden" test, which has become controlling
    and is a lot more relaxed than strict scrutiny:

    -   *Strict scrutiny*: A statute regulating abortion is
        constitutional if and only if it is narrowly tailed to serve a
        compelling state interest.

    -   *Undue burden*: A statute regulating abortion is constitutional
        unless the "regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman's
        ability to make \[the\] decision \[to have an abortion before
        viability\]."
        -   What is an undue burden? The plurality explains that "\[a\]n
            undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is
            invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial
            obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before
            the fetus attains viability."
        
        -   Why the undue burden standard? The plurality again: "What is
            at stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision,
            not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so.
            Regulations which do no more than create a structural
            mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a
            minor, may express profound respect for the life of the
            unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle
            to the woman's exercise of the right to choose."
    
-   In sharp contrast to *Roe*'s trimester framework, the undue burden
    test allows the state to regulate abortion even within the first
    trimester, so long as such regulations do not impose "a substantial
    obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion."

    -   Indeed, the *Casey* plurality rejects Roe's trimester framework
        as unnecessarily "rigid," noting: "The trimester framework
        suffers from these basic flaws: in its formulation it
        misconceives the nature of the pregnant woman's interest; and in
        practice it undervalues the State's interest in potential life,
        as recognized in *Roe*."

    -   Why cite *Roe* to support your conclusion when what you are
        doing is rejecting *Roe*? For the plurality, the reason is that
        the trimester framework is not "essential" to *Roe*'s holding.
        *Roe* is affirmed to the extent of its "essential" holding, and
        rejected otherwise.

        -   Using the undue burden test, the plurality finds that the
            only constitutional violation is the husband notification
            requirement along with the part of the reporting requirement
            that relates to husband notification.

        -   In a separate opinion, Justice Blackmun, the original author
            of *Roe*, would apply strict scrutiny to strike down all
            five provisions.

        -   Justice Stevens joins the part of the plurality opinion to
            strike down the husband notification requirement, although
            he argues that the plurality misapplies the undue burden
            test to the content-based counseling and 24-hour waiting
            period requirements, which he would strike down *under the
            undue burden standard*.

            -   For Justice Stevens, "A burden may be 'undue' either
                because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a
                legitimate, rational justification." We will come back
                to this point shortly.

        -   So, the Court ultimately strikes down only the husband
            notification requirement and the relevant part of the
            reporting requirement. This way, although the Court affirms
            *Roe* in name, it's severely gutted in substance.

## *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt* (2016)

-   *Whole Woman's Health* involves a constitutional challenge to two
    provisions of a Texas TRAP statute:

    -   *Admitting privileges*: "A physician performing or inducing an
        abortion . . . must, on the date the abortion is performed or
        induced, have active admitting privileges at a hospital that . .
        . is located not further than 30 miles from the location at
        which the abortion is performed or induced."

    -   *Surgical center*: "\[T\]he minimum standards for an abortion
        facility must be equivalent to the minimum standards adopted
        under \[another statutory provision\] for ambulatory surgical
        centers."

-   Texas defends its statute by appealing to a state interest in
    protecting women's health.
    -   However, as the district court finds, "The great weight of the
        evidence demonstrates that, before the act's passage, abortion
        in Texas was extremely safe with particularly low rates of
        serious complications and virtually no deaths occurring on
        account of the procedure."
        -   Justice Breyer, writing for himself and Justices Kennedy,
            Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, agrees, "Nationwide,
            childbirth is 14 times more likely than abortion to result
            in death, but Texas law allows a midwife to oversee
            childbirth in the patient's own home. Colonoscopy, a
            procedure that typically takes place outside a hospital (or
            surgical center) setting, has a mortality rate 10 times
            higher than an abortion." (internal citations omitted)
        
        -   And the safety of abortion actually makes obtaining
            admitting privileges exceedingly difficult: "\[An amicus\]
            brief describes the undisputed general fact that 'hospitals
            often condition admitting privileges on reaching a certain
            number of admissions per year.' Returning to the District
            Court record, we note that, in direct testimony, the
            president of Nova Health Systems, implicitly relying on this
            general fact, pointed out that it would be difficult for
            doctors regularly performing abortions at the El Paso clinic
            to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals because
            '\[d\]uring the past 10 years, over 17,000 abortion
            procedures were performed at the El Paso clinic \[and n\]ot
            a single one of those patients had to be transferred to a
            hospital for emergency treatment, much less admitted to the
            hospital.' In a word, doctors would be unable to maintain
            admitting privileges or obtain those privileges for the
            future, because the fact that abortions are so safe meant
            that providers were unlikely to have any patients to admit."
            (internal citations omitted)
        
    -   Furthermore, abortion providers are already required by Texas
        law to have a written protocol in place "for managing medical
        emergencies and the transfer of patients requiring further
        emergency care to a hospital."
    
        -   And the Court finds that "the surgical-center requirement
            provides no benefit when complications arise in the context
            of an abortion produced through medication . . . because, in
            such a case, complications would almost always arise only
            after the patient has *left* the facility." (emphasis added)
    
-   As the Court points out, the effects of the Texas statute are going
    to be devastating:

    -   Every year, about 60,000 to 72,000 Texas women seek abortions.

    -   After Texas passed the law in 2013, a group of abortion
        providers in Texas challenged the admitting privileges
        requirement in court and sought an injunction to prevent its
        enforcement. In *Planned Parenthood v. Abbott*, the district
        court granted an injunction. Three days later, the Fifth Circuit
        stayed the district court's injunction, allowing the requirement
        to go into effect, and the Fifth Circuit eventually upheld the
        constitutionality of the admitting privileges requirement.

    -   After the Fifth Circuit's decision, another group of abortion
        providers (including some of the original plaintiffs in *Planned
        Parenthood v. Abbott*) filed a different lawsuit, that is, the
        case we are considering right now, challenging the admitting
        privileges requirement *and* the surgical center requirement.

        -   The district court here finds that the admitting privileges
            requirement has forced the closure of *half* of the abortion
            clinics in Texas---from about 40 down to about 20.

        -   As the *Whole Woman's Health* majority summarizes the
            district court's findings, "before and after enforcement of
            the admitting-privileges requirement, 'the decrease in
            geographical distribution of abortion facilities' has meant
            that the number of women of reproductive age living more
            than 50 miles from a clinic has doubled (from 800,000 to
            over 1.6 million); those living more than 100 miles has
            increased by 150% (from 400,000 to 1 million); those living
            more than 150 miles has increased by more than 350% (from
            86,000 to 400,000); and those living more than 200 miles has
            increased by about 2,800% (from 10,000 to 290,000)."

        -   And should the surgical center requirement be enforced after
            this point, "only seven facilities and a potential eighth
            will exist in Texas," and only in major cities: "one
            facility in Austin, two in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, two in
            Houston, and either one or two in San Antonio." As a result
            of this, "the number of women of reproductive age living
            significant distances from an abortion provider will
            increase as follows: 2 million women of reproductive age
            will live more than 50 miles from an abortion provider; 1.3
            million will live more than 100 miles from an abortion
            provider; 900,000 will live more than 150 miles from an
            abortion provider; and 750,000 more than 200 miles from an
            abortion provider."

        -   Assuming a stable number of women in Texas need to access
            abortion each year, the reduction in the number of clinics
            also means an increase in the number of abortions each
            clinic needs to perform: indeed, as the Court notes, "from
            14,000 abortions annually to 60,000 to 70,000---an increase
            by a factor of about five." (internal quotation marks
            omitted)

-   A contentious issue in this case is how the undue burden test should
    be understood.

    -   Specifically, the question is whether courts should consider
        only the burdens the statute impose *without* regard to the
        existence or nonexistence of benefits, or should courts apply a
        balancing test to determine if the burdens *outweigh* the
        benefits?

        -   *Undue burden as a threshold test*: A statute regulating
            abortion is constitutional as long as the statute places
            less than X amount of obstacles in the path of a woman
            seeking an abortion before viability.

        -   *Undue burden as a balancing test*: A statute regulating
            abortion is constitutional if and only if the benefits
            outweigh the burdens.

    -   A 5--4 majority in *Whole Woman's Health* adopts the balancing
        test and thereby strikes down both provisions of the Texas
        statute:

        -   "We conclude that neither of these provisions confers
            medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon
            access that each imposes. Each places a substantial obstacle
            in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, each
            constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, *Casey*,
            supra, at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion), and each
            violates the Federal Constitution. Amdt. 14, § 1."

-   In her concurrence, Justice Ginsburg points out that Texas'
    proffered justification in terms of the protection of women's health
    is at best self-defeating if not pretextual: "When a State severely
    limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate
    circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, *faute
    de mieux*, at great risk to their health and safety. Targeted
    Regulation of Abortion Providers laws like \[the Texas statute\]
    that 'do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments
    to abortion,' cannot survive judicial inspection" (internal
    citations omitted).

## *June Medical Services v. Russo* (2020)

-   A Louisiana statute that is modeled after and virtually identical to
    the Texas statute the Court considered and struck down in *Whole
    Woman's Health* also requires a doctor to have admitting privileges
    at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion facility.

-   The procedural history of the Louisiana case is somewhat complex,
    but it is worth explaining because it is helpful for understanding
    the case:

    -   The Louisiana case began in 2014. The district court soon
        granted temporary restraining order to enjoin the enforcement of
        the Louisiana statute, and, after trial, granted preliminary
        junction in January 2016.

    -   Louisiana appealed the district court's order grating
        preliminary injunction to the Fifth Circuit, citing that Court's
        decision in the first Texas case *Planned Parenthood v. Abbot*
        that we just talked about.
        -   At this point, the U.S. Supreme Court already granted cert
            in *Whole Woman's Health*, but the decision would not be
            handed down until June.
        
    -   The Fifth Circuit stayed the injunction issued below to allow
        Louisiana to enforce the statute, prompting the abortion
        providers to file an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme
        Court to vacate the stay and restore the district court's
        preliminary injunction, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's
        resolution of *Whole Woman's Health*.
        -   The U.S. Supreme Court granted the application.
        
    -   After the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit in
        *Whole Woman's Health* and struck down the Texas admitting
        privileges requirement, the Fifth Circuit remanded the Louisiana
        case back to the district court for reconsideration in light of
        *Whole Woman's Health.*
    
    -   On remand, the district court, after extensive fact-finding,
        struck down the Louisiana admitting privileges requirement.
        -   The district court observes: "\[T\]here is no legally
            significant distinction between this case and \[*Whole
            Woman's Health*\]: \[The Louisiana Act\] was modeled after
            the Texas admitting privileges requirement, and it functions
            in the same manner, imposing significant obstacles to
            abortion access with no countervailing benefits. The Court
            is bound by the Supreme Court's clear guidance to reach the
            same result and strike down the Act."
        
    -   On appeal, while a divided Fifth Circuit panel acknowledged that
        "\[w\]e are of course bound by \[*Whole Woman's Health*\]
        holdings, announced in a case with a substantially similar
        statute," the panel reversed the district court and upheld the
        Louisiana admitting privileges requirements by distinguishing
        this case with *Whole Woman's health* because of "dissimilar
        facts and geography" between Louisiana and Texas.
        -   This prompted a harsh criticism from the dissenting judge:
            "The Supreme Court has previously admonished this court \[in
            *Whole Woman's Health*\] for 'imply\[ing\] that a trial
            court should not consider the existence or nonexistence of
            medical benefits when considering whether a regulation of
            abortion constitutes an undue burden.' By failing to
            meaningfully balance the burdens and benefits here, the
            court repeats its mistakes and leaves the undue burden test
            devoid of meaning."
        
    -   The full Fifth Circuit, divided 9--6, denied rehearing *en
        banc*. The U.S. Supreme Court granted cert.
    
-   The most important development in this Louisiana reenactment the was
    the fact that Justice Kennedy, who was in the five-member *Whole
    Woman's Health* majority, retired in 2018 and was replaced by
    Justice Kavanaugh.

    -   The remaining four members of the *Whole Woman's Health*
        majority---Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and
        Kagan---would apply the balancing test articulated in *Whole
        Woman's Health* and affirm the district court's judgment that
        the Louisiana statute was unconstitutional.
        -   But that was one vote short of a majority.
        
    -   The pivotal fifth vote to strike down the Louisiana statute came
        from Chief Justice Roberts, who originally dissented in *Whole
        Woman's Health*. However, Chief Justice Roberts did not switch
        sides because he changed his opinion on the merits of *Whole
        Woman's Health*, but really because the Fifth Circuit blatantly
        misapplied the U.S. Supreme Court's controlling precedent.
    
        -   He wrote, "I joined the dissent in *Whole Woman's Health*
            and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided.
            The question today however is not whether *Whole Woman's
            Health* was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in
            deciding the present case."
    
        -   "The legal doctrine of *stare decisis* requires us, absent
            special circumstances, to treat like cases alike. The
            Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as
            severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same
            reasons. Therefore Louisiana's law cannot stand under our
            precedents."
    
    -   Crucially, however, Roberts rejected *Whole Woman's Health*'s
        balancing test, applying instead the nonbalancing version of the
        undue burden test.
    
        -   He wrote, "\[Nothing\] about *Casey* suggested that a
            weighing of costs and benefits of an abortion regulation was
            a job for the courts. . . . So long as \[the statute is
            rationally related to a legitimate state interest\], the
            only question for a court is whether a law has the 'effect
            of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman
            seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.' "
    
    -   When there is no majority reasoning, courts are instructed by
        the Supreme Court to treat the opinion that provides narrowest
        grounds to get to the ruling as controlling.
    
        -   A popular initial impression among legal scholars and court
            watchers is that, because Roberts' reasoning is the
            narrowest, it effectively overrules *Whole Woman's Health*
            (by affirming it in name!) and send us back to *Casey*. Two
            circuits have reached this conclusion: *EMW Women's Surgical
            Center, P.S.C. v. Friedlander* (6th Cir. 2020) and
            *Hopkins v. Jegley* (8th Cir. 2020).
    
        -   However, some reproductive freedom advocates challenge the
            idea that Roberts' concurrence provides the narrowest
            grounds because it is not, so to speak, a logically subset
            of the plurality's reasoning (there is no common
            denominator) and also because Roberts seems to be discussing
            the right interpretation of *Casey* only in dicta (the
            operative reason for his conclusion is *stare decisis*). So,
            *Whole Woman's Health* is still good law. Two other circuits
            have arrived at this interpretation: *Whole Woman's
            Health v. Paxton* (5th Cir. 2020) and *Planned Parenthood of
            Indiana and Kentucky v. Box* (7th Cir. 2021).
