## The Supreme Court's Jurisdiction

-   A court has *jurisdiction* over a case if and only if it has the
    power to hear the case.

    -   Under Article III, the U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction over
        a *limited* range of cases: a couple of categories of cases that
        raise a federal question and a few others that involve diversity
        of citizenship. In contrast, state courts have *general*
        jurisdiction.

    -   Article III gives the Supreme Court both *appellate*
        jurisdiction (the power to hear and decide cases on appeal from
        lower courts) and *original* jurisdiction (the power to hear and
        decide cases initially rather than on appeal), but over
        different categories of cases.
        -   But even in original jurisdiction cases, the Court acts
            essentially as an appellate court. The typical practice is
            for the Court to appoint a "special master" (often a former
            law clerk of one of the justices) to act essentially as a
            trial judge, who will write a report recommending an
            outcome. The parties can then file briefs challenging or
            supporting the special master's report. This allows the
            Court to decide the case as if it is on appeal.
    
-   The vast majority of the cases on the Supreme Court's docket invoke
    its appellate jurisdiction.

    -   These are cases on appeal from lower federal courts and state
        courts of last resort.

    -   For the most part, the Supreme Court exercises *discretionary*
        jurisdiction, that is, it decides which cases it hears.

        -   In contrast, appeals at federal courts of appeals are a
            matter of right.

        -   However, *en banc* rehearings at federal courts of appeals
            are also discretionary.

## Cert Stage Proceedings

-   A party who wishes to appeal their case to the U.S. Supreme Court
    must petition the Court for a **writ of certiorari**.
    -   The opposing party (the respondent) can choose to file a brief
        in opposition (or not!), and the petitioner can file a reply
        brief in response to the BIO.
    
    -   Outside parties who have a stake in the case can also choose to
        file briefs as *amici curiae* in support of or in opposition to
        the cert petition.
    
-   The Court receives over 7,000 cert petitions each term.

    -   Many of the justices participate in what's called the "cert
        pool," where the participating justices share their law clerks
        in the cert review process.

    -   The Court generally does not consider its job to be error
        correction (supposedly, that's the job of the courts of
        appeals).

    -   Instead, arguably the most important reason the Court decides to
        hear a case is the presence of a *circuit split*, that is, when
        two or more circuit courts have disagreed on a question of
        federal law, resulting in federal law being interpreted and
        applied differently in different parts of the country.

    -   Some justices also favor grating cert wherever a federal law is
        struck down by a lower court, regardless of whether there is a
        circuit split.

    -   The denial of cert, on the other hand, does not necessarily mean
        the Court agrees with the judgment below.

    -   One justice is required for a case to be put onto the discuss
        list, that is, the list of cases that will be discussed in the
        justices' private conference. If no justice asks to put a case
        on the discuss list, it will be put on the dead list and cert
        will be denied.

    -   Four justices are required to grant cert. If fewer than four
        justices vote to hear a case, cert will be denied.

-   In recent years, the Court normally grants cert and hears oral
    argument in only 60--70 cases each term---these are cases on the
    Court's **merits docket**. That's a success rate of almost 1%. To
    put it in perspective, Harvard College's admission rate is as "high"
    as 4--5%.

## Merits Stage Proceedings

-   After the Court grants cert, the parties will file a new round of
    briefs addressing the case's merits.
    -   The petitioner will file an opening brief, to which the
        respondent will file a brief in response. The petitioner will
        then file another brief in response to the respondent's brief.
    
    -   Outside parties can file briefs as *amici curiae*.
    
-   The Court will then hear oral argument.

    -   The name "oral argument" is somewhat misleading. At least at the
        Supreme Court, oral arguments are really Q&A sessions. Advocates
        will usually have only two or three minutes presenting their
        arguments before being interrupted by the justices' questions.

    -   The assumption is the justices already read the parties'
        parties, so they know what their arguments are. Instead, the
        justices take oral arguments to be opportunities for them to ask
        for clarifications and press the advocates on points that bug
        them.

    -   But oral arguments serve another function: because the justices
        do not discuss the merits of the case as a group until *after*
        oral argument, and because the discussion has a very rigid
        structure that disadvantages the more junior justices (the
        justices speak in order of seniority), the more junior justices
        often use oral arguments as opportunities to talk to their more
        senior colleagues (but *through* the advocates' answers).

-   The Court will then take a preliminary vote at their private
    conference a few days after oral argument.

    -   Ordinarily, the Court can decide to affirm the judgment below,
        reverse or vacate it, or remand the case back down with
        instructions (or do some combination of the above).

        -   The Court can, of course, dispose of cases in non-ordinary
            ways. For example, occasionally, the Court will "dismiss" a
            writ of certiorari "as improvidently granted" (DIG for short)
            soon after oral argument.

    -   Normally, five justices are needed to form a majority. The most
        senior justice in the majority has the power to assign the
        *majority opinion*.
        -   Most majority opinions are signed, that is, the author will
            be identified.
        
        -   Unsigned opinions are called "*per curiam* opinions," which
            are issued simply in the name of the Court.
        
    -   If a justice disagrees with the majority's disposition of the
        case, they can choose to write a *dissenting opinion*.
    
    -   If a justice agrees with the majority's disposition but
        disagrees with the majority's reasoning, they can choose to
        write a *concurring opinion*.
    
    -   Since the vote is preliminary, it's possible that a justice
        originally in the majority will end up disagreeing with the
        draft majority opinion and refuse to *join* it. If the case is
        close, the draft majority opinion might not get the votes needed
        to be the opinion of the court.
    
        -   An opinion originally written as a dissent or concurrence
            can become the majority opinion if enough justices join it.
    
        -   It's possible for no opinion to get the enough votes to be
            the majority opinion, but if there is a majority that agrees
            the case should be disposed in a certain way, the case can
            be so disposed even though there is no majority reasoning
            that explains and justifies the disposition. The opinion
            that receives the most votes (but short of a majority) is
            the *plurality opinion*.
    
        -   If no disposition receives a majority of votes (for example,
            when the court is split 4-4, with one justice recused or one
            seat vacant), the Court will issue a one-sentence *per
            curium* opinion, stating "\[t\]he judgment is affirmed by an
            equally divided Court," with no explanation and no
            precedential effect.

## The Shadow Docket

-   So, normally, a case on the Court's merits docket will receive two
    rounds of briefing, the advocates will be able to answer the
    justices' questions at oral argument, and outside parties who have a
    stake will have opportunities to file *amicus* briefs.

    -   Someone in the majority will also write an opinion explaining
        and justifying the Court's ruling, they will read a version of
        the majority opinion from the bench on a pre-announced opinion
        day (and a justice who disagrees strongly can also choose to
        read their dissent from the bench, which is very rare) and the
        opinion will be scrutinized by Court watchers, legal scholars,
        the public, and sometimes other branches of the federal
        government or state governments.

    -   It's also important to remember that, normally, by the time a
        case got on the Court's merits docket, it had gone through at
        least one round of appellate review.

-   But the merits docket is not the only way the Court disposes of
    cases. Each term, the Court also issues thousands of "orders"
    outside of its merits dockets. The Court typically releases an order
    list on Monday mornings, but it also issues "miscellaneous orders"
    on random days and at random hours. Scholars call this body of
    Supreme Court cases its **shadow docket**.

    -   The vast majority of the Court's shadow docket actions are those
        granting or denying cert, extending deadlines for briefs,
        dividing oral arguments, etc.

    -   Some of the Court's shadow docket dispositions, however, are
        more consequential.

    -   Sometimes, the Court GVR's a case without the second round of
        briefing or oral argument---that is, *g*rant cert, *v*acate the
        judgment below and *r*emand to the lower court with instructions
        to reconsider the case in light of a recent decision or
        development.

    -   In some other cases, the Court grants cert and *summarily*
        reverses the judgment below without merits briefs or oral
        argument.

    -   The Court also uses the shadow docket to dispose of emergency
        petitions that ask the Court to issue an injunction, to stay a
        lower court order or to vacate a stay issued by a lower court.
        For example, the Court has issued shadow docket rulings in death
        penalty cases to vacate stays of execution issued by lower
        courts, in COVID cases to enjoin state governments from
        enforcing COVID restrictions, and in election cases to alter
        lower court rulings on absentee voting. These orders are, again,
        issued without merits briefs or oral argument, and often at odd
        hours.

-   Unlike the merits docket, the Court does not often issue opinions to
    explain or justify its shadow docket rulings. Sometimes, even the
    vote tally is unclear.

-   Stephen Vladeck notes that 2017--21 saw a significant shift in how
    the Court uses the shadow docket, compared to 2001--16:

    -   Increase in the number of instances where the Court alters lower
        court rulings at an early stage without going through the usual
        merits proceedings;

    -   Increase in the number of applications filed by the federal
        government asking the Court to intervene at an early stage (41
        from 2017 to 2021, compared to 8 from 2001 to 2017; 1 out of the
        41 was never considerd, 4 were withdrawn, and 24 out of the
        remaining 36 were fully successful and 4 partially successful);

    -   Increase in the divisiveness of shadow docket rulings (27 out of
        the 36 from 2017 to 2021 prompted at least one justice to
        dissent publicly, compared to 1 out of the 8 from 2001 to 2017);

    -   Vote counting raising more pressing questions about transparency
        in light of the increases (Vladeck's example: in *Dunn v.
        Smith*, the Court refused to allow Alabama to execute an inmate
        without allowing his pastor to be present in the execution
        chamber; Justices Kagan, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Barrett publicly
        noted their endorsement of the ruling; Justices Thomas and
        Kavanaugh and the Chief Justice publicly noted their dissents;
        that leaves Justices Alito and Gorsuch unaccounted for, and at
        least one of them must have been in the majority, but we don't
        know who was the fifth vote).

    -   Increase in the number of extraordinary relief granted using the
        shadow docket (e.g., certiorari before judgment);

    -   Confusion about the precedential effect of shadow docket rulings
        leading to lower court chaos (for example, early on in the
        pandemic, the Court allowed some COVID restrictions to go into
        effect but blocked others, often without offering any reasoning,
        which meant lower courts had to guess the Court's mind).

-   Vladeck argues the Court's shadow docket practice is problematic for
    eight reasons, regardless of whether one agrees with the substance
    of the shadow docket rulings:
    -   The absence of reasoning;
    
    -   The anonymity of the vote;
    
    -   The unpredictable timing of decisions (which inhibits public
        access and awareness of decisions);
    
    -   The lack of merits briefing/*amicus* participation/oral
        argument;
    
    -   The need for the justices to make predications at an early
        stage;
    
    -   The premature resolution of novel constitutional questions that
        have not been considered by other courts, and the unnecessary
        resolution of questions that turn out to be uncalled-for;
    
    -   The distortion of the balance of the Court's workload;
    
    -   The undermining of the Court's legitimacy.
