# *Bostock v. Clayton Country* (2020)

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## The Cases, the Law, and the Question

-   *Bostock* was consolidated with *Altitude Express v. Zarda* and
    *Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC*.
    -   Both Gerald Bostock and Donald Zarda were fired for being gay.
    
    -   Aimee Stephens was fired by Harris Funeral Homes for being
        transgender.
    
-   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment
    discrimination "because of . . . race, color, religion, sex, or
    national origin."

    -   Again, Title VII is not a constitutional provision.

-   *Question for the Court*: Does firing an employee because of their
    sexual orientation or gender identity necessarily constitute
    employment discrimination because of sex in violation of Title VII?

    -   The question is *not* whether sex is the same as sexual
        orientation or gender identity!

    -   Think about the relationship between discrimination because of
        pregnancy and discrimination because of sex:

        -   The same discriminatory act can constitute both
            discrimination because of pregnancy and discrimination
            because of sex.

        -   Indeed, if a discriminatory act constitutes discrimination
            because of pregnancy, then it also necessarily constitutes
            discrimination because of sex.

        -   This is not to say, pregnancy is the same as sex (recall
            Murray and Eastwood's point on maternal legislation).

    -   Similarly, the question is whether an act that discriminates
        because of sexual orientation or gender identity also
        necessarily constitutes an act that discriminates because of
        sex.

## Opinion of the Court (Justice Gorsuch)

-   But what does it mean to discriminate because of sex?

    -   Discriminate against: treat someone worse than another similarly
        situated person

    -   Sex: assumed by Grouch here, for the sake of argument, to be
        "biological sex."

        -   I will assume we can translate talk of "biological sex" into
            talk of "sex assigned at birth."

            -   For example, we can translate talk of "biological
                female" into talk of "person assigned female at birth."

            -   The reason is accuracy: Biological sex is at best an
                ambiguous category---are we talking about genitalia, sex
                chromosomes, sex hormones, assigned sex at birth, or
                what? It's important to see that all these markers can
                come apart. A person can have female-typed genitalia
                (even natal genitalia) but with male-typical sex hormone
                levels; a person can have ambiguous genitalia; a person
                can have neither XX nor XY sex chromosomes; etc. etc.

    -   Because of sex:

        -   Sex as the only cause: not required

        -   Sex as the primary cause: not required

        -   Sex as a but-for cause: were it not for their sex, the
            individual would not be discriminated against; adopted for
            the sake of argument

        -   Sex as a motivating factor: maybe, but nothing turns on this
            in the current cases.

-   Gorsuch's simple test

    -   Discrimination because of sex = "an employer who intentionally
        treats a person worse because \[at least in part\] of sex---such
        as by firing the person for actions or attributes it would
        tolerate in an individual of another sex---discriminates against
        that person in violation of Title VII."

    -   Since the Court applies the but-for test for causation, we can
        determine if there is sex discrimination by "changing \[only\]
        the employee's sex \[and see if it\] would have yielded a
        different choice by the employer."

    -   The cases in question:

        -   *Sexual orientation*: An individual, who was assigned *male*
            at birth, is attracted to someone else who was assigned male
            at birth.

        -   *Gender identity*: An individual, who was assigned *male* at
            birth, identifies as a woman.

        -   *Results*: Both individuals were fired.

    -   Changing the individual's sex assigned at birth:

        -   *Sexual orientation*: An individual, who was assigned
            *female* at birth, is attracted to someone else who was
            assigned male at birth.

        -   *Gender identity*: An individual, who was assigned *female*
            at birth, identifies as a woman.

        -   *Results*: Neither of them would have been fired.

    -   Gorsuch concluded, "it is impossible to discriminate against a
        person for being homosexual or transgender without
        discriminating against that individual based on sex."

    -   My cautious note: Gorsuch seems to be aware of this (?), but
        it's not made as clear as possible: it's very important to note
        that the simple but-for test is *sufficient* but *not necessary*
        for discrimination because of sex.

        -   In other words, if an act passes the but-for test, it is
            discrimination because of sex. However, if an act does not
            pass the but-for test, it does not follow that it is not
            discrimination because of sex.

        -   Example: bisexual discrimination

            -   Say, this is the case to be assessed: An individual, who
                was assigned *female* at birth, is attracted to someone
                else who was assigned female or another sex (or more
                sexes) at birth. This bisexual person is fired.

            -   If we vary the sex assigned: An individual, who was
                assigned *male* at birth, is attracted to someone else
                who was assigned female or another sex (or more sexes)
                at birth. This would still be a bisexual person, and
                they would be fired.

            -   However, clearly, if discrimination against gays and
                lesbians is discrimination on the basis of sex, then
                discrimination against bisexuals *must* be
                discrimination on the basis of sex. To suggest otherwise
                would be, to use MacKinnon's phrase, extraordinarily
                "analytical uncomfortable to the point of collapse."

        -   Another example: bigender discrimination

            -   Say, this is our case: An individual, who was assigned
                *male* at birth, identifies as a woman and another
                gender. This bigender person is fired.

            -   If we vary the sex assigned: An individual, who was
                assigned *female* at birth, identifies as a woman and
                another gender. This would still be a bigender person,
                and they would be fired.

            -   Likewise, to suggest discrimination against trans women
                and trans men is discrimination because of sex, but
                discrimination against bigender persons is not, would
                seem to be analytical sophistry.

        -   But the problem is not unique just to people who are
            attracted to more than one gender or identify as more than
            one gender. Consider, say, a case of intersectional
            discrimination in which a person is discriminated against
            because of their sexual orientation AND gender identity.

            -   Suppose an employer has the following hiring policy:

            |                 | Trans     | Cis   |
            |-----------------|-----------|-------|
            | Nonheterosexual | Not hired | Hired |
            | Heterosexual    | Hired     | Hired |

            -   There is no discrimination because of gender identity
                because heterosexual trans individuals are hired.

            -   There is also no discrimination because of sexual
                orientation because nonheterosexual cis individuals are
                hired.

            -   Yet, nonheterosexual trans individuals are not hired for
                being nonheterosexual AND trans.

## Justice Alito's Dissent

-   Justice Alito's objections:

    1.  *War of hypotheticals*: The Court's hypotheticals are not the
        right hypotheticals.

    2.  *Expectation of the framers*: No one in 1964 would have thought
        discrimination because of sex meant discrimination because of
        sexual orientation or gender identity.

    3.  *Inherent constitution*: Discrimination because of sexual
        orientation or gender identity does not *inherently* constitute
        discrimination because of sex.

-   The war of hypotheticals

    -   For simplicity, consider one of the cases: an individual, who
        was assigned *female* at birth, is attracted to someone else who
        was assigned *female* at birth.

    -   Gorsuch's hypothetical: an individual, who was assigned *male*
        at birth, is attracted to someone else who was assigned *female*
        at birth.
        -   Alito: Stop right here! You are not *just* changing the
            individual's sex---you are *also* changing their sexual
            orientation by sleight of hand!
        
    -   Alito's hypothetical: an individual, who was assigned *male* at
        birth, is attracted to someone else who was assigned *male* at
        birth.
    
        -   Alito: See! This individual would have been fired. It does
            not pass the but-for test! No sex discrimination!
    
    -   Responses?
    
        -   First of all, if we accept the simple test is a sufficient
            but unnecessary test, it's unclear what Justice Alito's
            hypothetical proves---okay, maybe it does not pass the
            but-for test, but that does not entail it is not sex
            discrimination (for example, the Court could have used the
            more lenient motivating cause standard).
    
        -   But what's more puzzling is how Justice Alito seems to
            understand how sexual orientation works.
    
            -   Sexual orientation is not a simple, but a *composite*
                property: which sexual orientation you have depends not
                only on the sex you were assigned at birth but also on
                the sex(es) of who you are attracted to. As a result, if
                you change the sex you were assigned at birth, you
                *necessarily* change your sexual orientation! In order
                to hold your sexual orientation fixed, you would have to
                change another thing: the sex(es) of who you are
                attracted to. In the end, it is Alito's hypothetical
                that changed more than one thing.
    
            -   In contrast, the Court analyzes both "being gay" and
                "being transgender" as consisting of two elements:
                "*both* the individual's sex *and* something else"
                (emphasis in original). So, to be a gay/lesbian person
                is to *both* be assigned a certain sex at birth *and* be
                attracted to (only) people of the same sex as you. And
                to be a trans person is to *both* be assigned a certain
                sex at birth and *identify* as a gender that does not
                align with your sex assigned at birth.
    
            -   So, it's not that the Court's hypothetical changes
                *both* the sex *and* the sexual orientation of the
                individual, but that sex is a *constitutive* part of
                sexual orientation so changing one necessarily leads to
                the other also changing.
    
            -   And precisely because sex is a constitutive part of
                sexual orientation, discrimination based on sexual
                orientation entails discrimination based on sex. To use
                Gorsuch's example: "Consider an employer with a policy
                of firing any woman he discovers to be a Yankees fan.
                Carrying out that rule because an employee is a woman
                *and* a fan of the Yankees is a firing 'because of sex'
                if the employer would have tolerated the same allegiance
                in a male employee. Likewise here. When an employer
                fires an employee because she is homosexual or
                transgender, two causal factors may be in play---*both*
                the individual's sex *and* something else (the sex to
                which the individual is attracted or with which the
                individual identifies). But Title VII doesn't care. If
                an employer would not have discharged an employee but
                for that individual's sex, the statute's causation
                standard is met, and liability may attach." (emphasis in
                original)
    
-   Expectation originalism, again

    -   Alito objects that no one at the time of Title VII's enactment
        would have thought discrimination because of sex meant
        discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity.

        -   It's interesting how this objection essentially boils down
            to who is the true heir to Justice Scalia, and how "\[t\]he
            Court's opinion is like a pirate ship . . . sail\[ing\]
            under a textualist flag." But let's set that aside.

    -   The problem is we need to distinguish expectation and semantic
        originalism:

        -   *Expectation originalism*: Title VII means what the law
            makers *expected* to mean. That is, "discrimination because
            of sex" means "discrimination that we take to be
            discrimination because of sex."

    -   Granted that Alito is right that the drafters of Title VII did
        not expect what they wrote down to prohibit discrimination
        because of sexual orientation or gender identity. It shouldn't
        matter what the drafters expected in their own heads. They chose
        to enact general language. Even Justice Scalia would not buy
        this interpretation.

        -   *Semantic originalism*: Title VII means what the law makers
            *intended* to mean.
            -   *Concrete and dated semantic Intent*: Title VII means
                what the law makers intended to mean in a concrete and
                dated sense. That is, "discrimination because of sex"
                means "discrimination widely regarded as discrimination
                because of sex at the date of this enactment." But,
                again, even Justice Scalia would not buy this
                interpretation.
            
            -   *Principled and dated semantic intent*: Title VII means
                what the law makers intended to mean in a principled and
                dated sense. That is, "discrimination because of sex"
                means "whatever discrimination that fits what we
                consider discrimination because of sex today."
                Interestingly, this would seem to lead to Gorsuch's
                conclusion (recall that Gorsuch assumes, for the sake of
                argument, that "sex" just means "biological sex," which
                was probably what people thought "sex" meant in 1964).
            
            -   *Principled and timeless semantic intent*: Title VII
                means what the law makers intended to mean in a
                principled and timeless sense. That is, "discrimination
                because of sex" means "whatever discrimination that is
                in fact discrimination because of sex." Proponents of
                this approach would have no problem agreeing with
                Gorsuch.
    
-   Inherent constitution

    -   Alito argues discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
        or gender identity does not *inherently* constitute
        discrimination on the basis of sex because it is possible to
        discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender
        identity without *knowing* the sex of the individual.
        -   His example: A question on the application form asks, "Are
            you gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender?" I don't need to
            know which sex you are, and I can still discriminate against
            your sexual orientation or gender identity. See, not sex
            discrimination!
        
        -   Gorsuch's response: Well, consider a different question,
            "Are you Black or Catholic?" It's still discrimination!
            -   Alito: "How this hypothetical proves the Court's point
                is a mystery."
            
        -   Gorsuch's better response: In order to answer "Are you
            LGBT?", the *applicant* has to know and rely on their own
            sex.
        
            -   Alito: Still, the employer does not have to know! And if
                the employer does not know the sex of the applicant, it
                can't discriminate on the basis of sex.
        
    -   A better response to Justice Alito?

        -   Justice Alito seems to have in mind some version of the
            equal application argument: the policy is not sex
            discriminatory because it discriminates against each sex
            *equally*.
    
            -   Compare this with Virginia's argument in *Loving*: the
                ban on interracial marriage is not race discriminatory
                because it discriminates against each race equally. That
                logic was squarely rejected by the Court.
    
            -   But Alito has a ready reply here: the reason why
                discrimination based on interracial marriage constitutes
                racial discrimination is "history tells us is a core
                form of race discrimination." He explains,
                "Discrimination because of sexual orientation is
                different. It cannot be regarded as a form of sex
                discrimination on the ground that applies in race cases
                since discrimination because of sexual orientation is
                not historically tied to a project that aims to
                subjugate either men or women. An employer who
                discriminates on this ground might be called
                'homophobic' or 'transphobic,' but not sexist."
    
        -   To be fair, it's good that Justice Alito explicitly nods at
            the dominance approach. But, what?
    
            -   Think about gay men: Part of the homophobia experienced
                by gay men is how they fail to live up to the ideals of
                a *man*, which include, importantly, being attracted to
                women. Feminine-presenting gay men, as well as bottoms,
                in particular, are thought to directly take the role of
                woman, which, of course, is inferior---indeed,
                emasculating.
    
            -   Think also about the common rhetoric that a woman is a
                lesbian because she has not found *the* man. Femme
                lesbians often have their sexual orientation doubted
                because they are so "pretty," and butch lesbians are
                often viewed as intruding into the domain of man.
    
            -   The experiences of trans and nonbinary people are also
                telling: It's plainly inconceivable to people how
                someone assigned male at birth would want to give up
                their male privileges. And people often assume someone
                assigned female at birth would want not to be a woman
                only because of internalized misogyny.
    
        -   Speaking of the dominance approach: if you are sympathetic
            to the dominance approach, and if you think sexual
            orientation and gender identity are markers used by some
            system or systems of domination to pick out groups of
            individuals, assign those groups to subordinate social
            positions, and justify their so occupying these subordinate
            social positions, then that's the end of the inquiry.
    
            -   The but-for test, which follows the traditional
                sameness/difference approach, yields the same
                conclusion, but it's not the only way to get there. And,
                indeed, perhaps not the way to get all the way there
                (bisexual discrimination, bigender discrimination,
                intersectional sexual orientation and gender identity
                discrimination, etc.).
