## Another Trilogy of Embarrassment

-   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment
    discrimination "because of . . . race, color, religion, sex, or
    national origin."

-   Following the traditional approach, what Title VII requires is
    employers must treat similarly situated employees similarly.

    -   For example, if a Black employee and a white employee are
        similarly situated, then the employer cannot treat one of them
        more favorably than the other.

-   But the approach is responsible for another trilogy of
    embarrassment:

    - *DeGraffenreid v. General Motors* (E.D. Mo. 1976)

      -   *Facts*: General Motors had a "last hired, first fired"
          policy, but the company did not hire Black women until 1964
          (it did hire women prior to 1964, but only white women). As
          a result of this past structural discrimination, all Black
          women hired after 1970 were fired during a layoff due to
          their lack of seniority. A group of five Black women sued,
          arguing the "last hired, first fired" policy violated Title
          VII.

      -   The district court refused to allow a combined sex-race
          discrimination claim, noting:

          -   "\[P\]laintiffs have failed to cite any decisions which
              have stated that Black women are a special class to be
              protected from discrimination. The Court's own research
              has failed to disclose such a decision. The plaintiffs
              are clearly entitled to a remedy if they have been
              discriminated against. However, they should not be
              allowed to combine statutory remedies to create a new
              'super-remedy' which would give them relief beyond what
              the drafters of the relevant statutes intended. Thus,
              this lawsuit must be examined to see if it states a
              cause of action for race discrimination, sex
              discrimination, or alternatively either, but not a
              combination of both" (emphasis added).

      -   The court then rejected the sex discrimination claim because
          women (read: white women) were hired by General Motors.

      -   Now, imagine the following hypothetical hiring policy:

          |       | Women     | Men   |
          |-------|-----------|-------|
          | Black | Not hired | Hired |
          | White | Hired     | Hired |

          -   Using the court's logic, there is no sex discrimination
              because white women are hired.
    
          -   There is also no race discrimination because Black men
              are hired.
    
          -   But Black women are not hired for being *Black women*.
    
      -   *First lesson*: Single-axis analysis obscures ways in which
          discrimination can be *combined*.
    
    -   *Moore v. Hughes Helicopter* (9th Cir. 1983)
    
        -   Facts: Tommie Moore, a Black woman, brought a class action
            claim against Hughes Helicopter on behalf of all women
            employees, arguing the company's promotion practices
            violated Title VII.
    
        -   But the court refused to certify Moore as class
            representative:
    
            -   "Moore had never claimed before the EEOC that she was
                discriminated against as a female, but only as a Black
                female . . . . \[T\]his raised serious doubts as to
                Moore's ability to adequately represent white female
                employees."
    
            -   Implications: Sex discrimination claims brought by white
                women are somehow more "standard" or "pure" sex
                discrimination. That is, white women can more
                "adequately represent" the interests of all women
                employees than Black women.
    
            -   Crenshaw writes, "The court's preference for 'against
                females' rather than 'against Black females' reveals the
                implicit grounding of white female experiences in the
                doctrinal conceptualization of sex discrimination. For
                white women, claiming sex discrimination is simply a
                statement that but for gender, they would not have been
                disadvantaged. For them there is no need to specify
                discrimination as white females because their race does
                not contribute to the disadvantage for which they seek
                redress."
    
        -   *Second lesson*: Single-axis analysis is not really so
            "single"-axis; rather, such analysis "takes race privilege
            as a given."
    
    -   *Payne v. Travenol* (5th Cir. 1982)
    
        -   Facts: The district court refused to allow two Black women
            to represent all Black employees. Instead, the District
            Court allowed them only to represent all Black women
            employees. The District Court eventually found racial
            discrimination and awarded remedies, but refused to extend
            the remedies to Black men employees. The court of appeals
            affirmed.
    
        -   Again, the assumption is Black women cannot adequately
            represent the interests of all Black employees, particularly
            Black men employees.

-   Collectively, Crenshaw argues, these cases create a dilemma for
    Black women:

    -   Black women can choose to sue as Black women, as Black persons,
        or as women:

        -   If they choose to sue as Black women:

            -   Either courts simply can't understand what they are even
                saying (as in *DeGraffenreid*);

            -   Or courts will allow them to represent "only" Black
                women, not all women or all Black persons (as in *Moore*
                and *Payne*).

        -   If they choose to sue as Black persons or as women, the
            discrimination they suffer as Black women is obscured.

    -   Question: How can it be the case that it harms Black women to
        both recognize them as a distinct class, and not to recognize
        them as a distinct class?

        -   Crenshaw explains, "This apparent contradiction is but
            another manifestation of the conceptual limitations of the
            single-issue analyses that intersectionality challenges. The
            point is that Black women can experience discrimination in
            any number of ways and that the contradiction arises from
            our assumptions that their claims of exclusion must be
            unidirectional. Consider an analogy to traffic in an
            intersection, coming and going in all four directions.
            Discrimination, like traffic through an intersection, may
            flow in one direction, and it may flow in another. If an
            accident happens in an intersection, it can be caused by
            cars traveling from any number of directions and, sometimes,
            from all of them. Similarly, if a Black woman is harmed
            because she is in the intersection, her injury could result
            from sex discrimination or race discrimination."

        -   Crenshaw distinguishes:

            -   *Double discrimination*: Black women can experience
                discrimination as Black persons and discrimination as
                women.

            -   *Intersectional discrimination*: Black women can also
                experience discrimination as *Black women*.

        -   Here, the point is that discrimination Black women
            experience is not the mere addition of the discrimination
            Black persons experience plus the discrimination women
            experience. But there is something unique to discrimination
            Black women *at the intersection*---where discrimination
            against Black persons and discrimination against women
            multiply.

## Intersectional Discrimination

-   Crenshaw argues the dominant antidiscrimination doctrine is
    inadequate because it fails to account for intersectional
    discrimination:

    -   The dominant doctrine starts by identifying a factor (race,
        gender, etc.) that should have nothing to do with employment
        decisions, and then applies that factor to identify a group
        disadvantaged by its use.

        -   The assumption is, if the factor is indeed in play, then
            those identified by this factor should all be disadvantaged
            by its use. That is, discrimination occurs *inter*-group
            (e.g., between Black people and white people), but not
            *intra*-group (e.g., all Black people are discriminated
            again similarly). For example, if gender is thought to
            interfere with employment decisions, then we should expect
            to see all women be disadvantaged by the use of gender.

            -   How do we know? The standard test is the *but-for* test:
                a person is discriminated against because of their
                \[sex, race, etc.\] just in case they would not be
                discriminated against were it not for their \[sex, race,
                etc.\].

        -   For Crenshaw, this creates two problems:

            -   It means antidiscrimination protections only apply to
                the most privileged---those who have been treated the
                same as members of the dominant group *but for* their
                sex, race, etc.

            -   The dominant approach thereby tends to focus narrowly on
                the discrimination experienced by white women and Black
                men---the most privileged women and the most privileged
                Black persons. Black women can make their claims
                intelligible only when their situations can be
                recognized as the same as those of white women and Black
                men.

-   Crenshaw thinks there is a general lesson for feminist theory and
    antiracist politics:

    -   As Crenshaw puts it, "In much of feminist theory and, to some
        extent, in antiracist politics, this framework is reflected in
        the belief that sexism or racism can be meaningfully discussed
        without paying attention to the lives of those other than the
        race-, gender- or class-privileged. As a result, both feminist
        theory and antiracist politics have been organized, in part,
        around the equation of racism with what happens to the Black
        middle-class or to Black men, and the equation of sexism with
        what happens to white women."

    -   This is because, when we analyze only "pure" gender
        discrimination, we focus on people who are discriminated against
        only because of their gender---that is, people who would be the
        same as white men but for their gender, mostly white women.

    -   The point is easily generalizable to class, ethnicity,
        nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability
        status, etc. When we analyze only "pure" gender discrimination,
        we risk analyzing only the discrimination experienced by white,
        relatively affluent, American, heterosexual, able-bodied cis
        women.
