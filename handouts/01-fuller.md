# Lon Fuller, “The Problem of the Grudge Informer”

PHIL 324: Law and Morality\
Ding (University of Arizona)

## Purposes of This Module

-   An introduction to one of the foundational disagreements in the
    philosophy of law---the dispute between natural law theory and
    legal positivism.

-   A crash course on the U.S. Supreme Court and the Equal Protection
    Clause of the 14th Amendment.

## The Grudge Informer Case

-   The Purple Shirts came to power after a suspicious election.

    -   Even though the Constitution, the Criminal Code, and other laws
        were never explicitly repealed, they were systemically
        neglected, misinterpreted, or misapplied.

    -   Secret statutes and retroactive statutes were enacted.

    -   Extralegal taking of property, beating, and killing were used.

    -   Grudge informers reported personal enemies to the Purple Shirt
        authorities for political dissent and trivial offenses (like
        making political criticisms, listening to foreign radio
        broadcasts and failing to report loss of identification
        documents within five days) that were nevertheless crimes
        punishable by death.

-   The case is based on a real case:

    -   A wife wanted to get rid of her husband. So, she reported his
        insulting remarks about Hitler to the Nazi authorities.

    -   The husband was tried and sentenced to death in accordance with
        Nazi statutes.

    -   Following the collapse of the Nazi regime, the wife was
        prosecuted under the German Criminal Code, which prohibited
        "illegally depriving a person of his freedom."

    -   The wife argued that, given that she acted in pursuant to the
        Nazi statutes, the deprivation of freedom was not "illegal."

-   It seems what should be done about the grudge informers
    depends in important part on whether the grudge informers did
    anything illegal:

    -   If what they did was illegal, then it's perhaps easy to justify
        holding them legally responsible for their conduct.

        -   Yet, is it's not obvious how the grudge informers could have
            done anything illegal given they acted in accordance with
            statutes that were actually in effect at the time.

    -   If the grudge informers did not act illegally, then using the
        law to punish them would, *prima facie*, offend the rule of law.

## What Should We Do? The Deputies' Recommendations

-   Deputy 1: We should do nothing because what the grudge informer did
    was not illegal.

    -   The statutes enacted by the Purple Shirts were valid laws
        because the Purple Shirt government was in actual control of the
        country's affairs.

-   Deputy 2: We should do nothing because what the grudge informer did
    was "alegal"---neither legal nor illegal, but simply done in the
    absence of law.

    -   For there to be a legal system, there must be:

        1.  Knowable laws;

        2.  Uniformity of action and treatment; and

        3.  No lawless power like the Purple Shirts.

    -   So, under the Purple Shirts, there was simply no rule of law. It
        was just anarchy. No statutes enacted by the Purple Shirts could
        have been valid laws.

-   Deputy 3: We should treat different cases differently.

    -   The statutes enacted by the Purple Shirts were valid laws other
        than those that "perverted the administration of justice from
        its normal aims and uses."

    -   Also, much of the previous legal system was left undisturbed.

    -   So, we should punish at least those who acted out of the "desire
        to get rid of those they accused" because such acts were illegal
        under the Criminal Code which was still in effect.

-   Deputy 4: Basically agrees with Deputy 3, but emphasizes the need to
    deal with the grudge informers in a principled manner by enacting an
    *ex post facto* statute.

-   Deputy 5: No, an *ex post facto* statute is out of the question.

    -   A wrongful means cannot correct the wrongful acts of the Purple
        Shirts.

    -   And even if we want to, it is not practical to craft such a
        statute.

    -   The government should therefore let the people handle the
        situation directly without getting the law involved at all.

## Grounds of Legal Validity

-   The grudge informer case illustrates a deep conceptual question
    about the ***grounds* of legal validity**:

    -   What *makes* a law legally valid? Or, *in virtue of* what is a
        law a legally valid one?

-   **Social Thesis**: A law is legally valid entirely in virtue of
    certain *social*, nonmoral facts.

    -   Example: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 is legally
        valid in virtue of the fact that the statute was passed by both
        houses of Congress, signed by the President and not struck down
        by a court.

    -   Legal positivists famously accept the Social Thesis, whereas
        natural law theorists deny it.

        -   For natural law theorists, a law is legally valid in part in
            virtue of the fact that it satisfies certain *moral*
            requirements.

    -   Here is one example to illustrate the disagreement between legal
        positivism and natural law theory:

        -   In *Loving v. Virginia* (1967), the U.S. Supreme Court
            relied on the 14th Amendment to strike down a Virginia law
            that criminalized interracial marriage.

        -   For a legal positivist, Virginia's ban was made invalid only
            by the Court's decision---before the Court decided *Loving*,
            the ban had been legally valid because it was passed by a
            state legislature and signed into the law by the governor.

        -   A natural law theorist, however, would think that the ban
            had not been legally valid even before *Loving* was decided
            simply for failure to satisfy the requirements of morality.

-   **Conceptual Separability Thesis**: There is no necessary conceptual
    connection between law and morality.

    -   In other words, it is not in the nature of law that it must
        satisfy certain moral requirements in order to be valid, or,
        metaphorically speaking, morality is not somehow "internal" to
        law.

    -   Again, while legal positivists accept the Conceptual
        Separability Thesis, natural law theorists deny it.
