## Hart's Objections to Austin's Account

-   Hart is also a legal positivist, but he finds Austin's account
    inadequate.
    -   Recall that, on Austin's account, laws are general commands of
        the sovereign to their subjects, backed up by sanctions for
        noncompliance.
    
-   Hart's Objections:

    -   Objection 1: The closest case of a coercive command of the
        sovereign to their subjects in the law is perhaps criminal law,
        which commands actions with enforceable penalties for
        noncompliance. But even in criminal law the analogy breaks down
        because criminal law binds the law makers themselves too. The
        law makers can't really threaten themselves with sanctions in
        case they don't obey their own commands?

        -   Imagine the sovereign commands themself to obey traffic laws
            under penalty. Now, at a stop sign, the sovereign is like,
            "Oh, I don't care," and runs it. There is no obvious sense
            in which the sovereign is disobeying their own command,
            because once the sovereign changes their mind, the earlier
            command is no longer in effect. An earlier time slice of the
            sovereign does not seem to be able to issue a command
            binding on a later time slice of themself.

        -   A possible response: We can distinguish law makers acting in
            their *official* capacity as law makers and them acting in
            their *private* capacity as citizens. It makes sense to say
            law makers acting in their official capacity can bind
            themselves as citizens.
            -   Hart's worry: Sure, but we need a law to define what
                counts and what does not count as acting in one's
                official capacity, but Austin's account cannot account
                for a law like that because a definition is not
                obviously a *command*.
        
    -   Objection 2: Although Austin's account may be useful for
        analyzing laws that impose duties, it's inadequate for
        explaining laws that merely confer powers or create relations.
        -   For example, think about laws that create marriage relations
            between individuals: What is the command? Who is being
            commanded? What is the penalty for noncompliance??
        
        -   A possible response: Laws that merely confer powers or
            create relations are commands to *public officials*---in our
            example, they are commanded to issue a marriage license as
            long as certain conditions obtain and they will be
            sanctioned if they don't.
            -   Hart's worry: This response "distort\[s\] the ways in
                which these \[laws\] are spoken of, thought of, and
                actually used in social life." We don't normally
                understand, say, marriage laws as commands to public
                officials. It's like saying "all the rules of a game are
                'really' directions to the umpire and the scorer," not
                the players.
        
    -   Objection 3: Austin's account struggles to explain laws "not
        brought into being by anything analogous to explicit
        prescription," such as judge-made laws.
    
        -   Austin's response: They are the *tacit* commands of the
            sovereign.
            -   Hart's worry: This is an oversimplification of the
                source of the modern legal system's authority. For
                example, suppose the Supreme Court rules against the
                sitting Congress and the sitting President. How can the
                Court's decision be the tacit commands of the sovereign
                if the two other branches disagree with it?
        
    -   Objection 4: Austin's account cannot explain the "the continuity
        of legislative authority characteristic of a modern legal
        system."
        -   Imagine the sovereign dies and a new sovereign takes over.
        
            -   How is the new sovereign's first command binding when
                they are not yet obeyed *habitually*?
        
            -   How can the previous sovereign's commands still be
                binding now that they are dead and no longer obeyed
                habitually?
        
        -   A possible response: The previous sovereign leaves a tacit
            command for their subjects to obey the new sovereign.
            -   Worry 1: This seems too metaphysically spooky. In order
                to make it work, there needs to be an overlapping period
                in which there are two sovereigns. That's not how we
                ordinarily understand the way the transfer of sovereign
                power works.
            
            -   Worry 2: Nothing prevents the previous sovereign from
                explicitly rejecting this tacit command. Think about
                former President Trump, who refused to concede defeat.
            
            -   Worry 3: Even if the previous sovereign makes the tacit
                command, it's not how we usually think of the source of
                the authority of the next sovereign. For example, we
                think a new President or a new Congress has their
                authority because they are duly elected under the
                Constitution, not because the previous President or
                Congress tacitly commanded us to obey the new one.
    
-   Hart's diagnosis: "The root cause of failure is that the elements
    out of which \[Austin's\] theory was constructed, viz. the ideas of
    orders, obedience, habits, and threats, do not include, and cannot
    by their combination yield, the idea of a *rule*, without which we
    cannot hope to elucidate even the most elementary forms of law" (my
    emphasis).
    -   Specifically, Hart means rules in a *normative* rather than
        purely descriptive sense: Laws as rules provide us with
        *reasons* for action and *standards* for evaluating action. They
        don't just exert pressure on us, but we can *feel* this pressure
        subjectively. It makes us say things like, "I'm *obligated* to
        do this."
    
    -   Austin's account does include an analysis of obligation: For
        Austin, a person is obligated to do something if and only if
        this person faces the likelihood of sanctions in case they fail
        to do it.
    
        -   Hart thinks there's a fundamental problem with Austin's
            account: It confuses being *obliged* to do something and
            being *obligated* to do something.
    
            -   Hart's Gunman Example: Imagine a gunman commands you to
                give them your money or they will shoot you. In this
                case, you face the likelihood of sanctions if you do not
                give the gunman your money, and, on Austin's account, it
                follows that you are obligated to give the gunman your
                money. That's absurd. Even though you might be *obliged*
                to hand over your money, you are not *obligated* to do
                it.
    
        -   Another way to put it: Austin's account fails to account for
            what Hart calls the "internal" point of view:
    
            -   Austin's account analyzes law from the *external* point
                of view: It's as if we are analyzing the law as an
                outside observer. We are there merely to recognize
                certain regularities. We discover that once a person
                violates a law, there is a likelihood that they will be
                penalized.
    
            -   Hart worries that Austin's account misses out on the
                internal point of view: The law has certain important
                features that we can see only as participants *in* the
                legal system---people who "accept" the laws as providing
                reasons for action, who "fall\[\] under" these laws.
    
            -   Hart's example is the red light: From the external point
                of view, the red light is merely a *sign* or *indicator*
                that people will stop. But this fails to see something
                else that's important about the red light: it is also a
                *signal* for people to stop in the sense that people
                take the red light as a reason for stopping, which
                exerts a kind of pressure that they can feel internally
                or subjectively.
    
    -   The job, then, is to offer an alternative account of law that
        respects the internal point of view.
    
        -   This is difficult for a legal positivist like Hart: The
            easiest way to capture the internal point of view is in
            terms of morality (*prima facie*, moral rules provide us
            with reasons for action, and legal rules can provide reasons
            for action if morality is internal to them), but, for legal
            positivists, that's such a no-no.

## Hart's Account of Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules

-   Hart argues that the central case of law is best understood in terms
    of the union of *primary* and *secondary* rules.

    -   Central case: There are laws that are not best understood this
        way, like international law. But these are "disputable or
        borderline examples of law," not something an analysis of law
        should focus on centrally or primarily.

    -   Two types of rules:

        -   *Primary rules*: Rules that require people to do this or not
            to do that.

        -   *Secondary rules*: Rules that provide methods for
            introducing new primary rules or modifying, repealing, or
            otherwise controlling the operations of existing primary
            rules; secondary rules are rules *about* primary rules.

    -   Example:

        -   Primary rule: The Voting Rights Act of 1965, which, among
            other things, prohibits the use of racially discriminatory
            devices or procedures in voting (such as literacy tests) and
            requires that, if a jurisdiction with a history of racial
            discrimination in voting wishes to change its election laws
            or procedures, it must obtain preclearance from the Attorney
            General of the United States or a three-judge panel of the
            U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (The
            preclearance requirement was ruled unconstitutional by the
            U.S. Supreme Court in *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013).)

        -   Secondary rule: A bill becomes a primary rule (or a set of
            primary rules) when it is passed by both houses of Congress
            and signed by the President.

-   Importantly, for Hart, both primary and secondary rules are needed
    for an adequate analysis of the salient features of a modern system.
    To illustrate this, Hart invites us to consider what a society would
    be like without them.
    -   A society without any primary rules would not function.
    
        -   For even a small, close-knit society to work, it needs at
            least (1) primary rules that "contain in some form
            restrictions on violence, theft and, deception" and (2) the
            bulk of the population following these primary rules from
            the internal point of view.
    
    -   But a society with only primary rules has three important
        "defects":
    
        -   *Uncertainty*: There are no ways to settle doubts or
            disagreements about what rules there are.
    
            -   To remedy this uncertainty, we need, in addition to
                primary rules, a secondary rule that authoritatively
                identifies which rules are legally valid, which Hart
                calls a *rule of recognition*.
    
            -   The rule of recognition is not always explicitly stated,
                but it is *used* by those within the legal system for
                identifying the rules that exist in that legal system.
                For example, if I think murder is legally permissible,
                you think it is not, then the only way we can settle our
                dispute is to use the rule of recognition to find out
                what the relevant rules are.
    
            -   Note that the rule of recognition is understood from the
                internal point of view: It must provide the
                "authoritative" ways of identifying rules, where this
                authoritativeness is seen from the perspective of
                someone within the legal system who *accepts* the rules
                identified by the rule of recognition as laws.
    
            -   The rule of recognition can be as simply as "whatever is
                carved on this tablet is law."
    
            -   It can also be a lot more complex and provide multiple
                criteria for identifying legally valid rules, like
                "whatever is in this written document called 'the
                Constitution,' or whatever is enacted by Congress, or
                whatever is decided by the courts is law."
    
            -   Most often, these criteria are hierarchical: Some of the
                criteria will be "prior" to or more "primary" than
                others, and there will be a criterion that's the most
                primary---the *supreme* one.
    
            -   There can also be multiple rules of recognition in a
                legal system, but they are likewise hierarchical: Some
                rules of recognition are themselves identified as
                legally valid by other rules of recognition. For
                example, regulations issued by the FDA are valid laws,
                but this rule of recognition is itself identified as
                legally valid by a more fundamental rule of recognition.
    
            -   At the end of the day, there has to be an *ultimate*
                rule of recognition which "provides criteria for the
                assessment of the validity of other rules" even though
                "no rule provid\[es\] criteria for the assessment of"
                the validity of the ultimate rule of recognition---the
                ultimate rule of recognition "can neither be valid nor
                invalid but is simply accepted as appropriate for use in
                this way."
    
        -   *Staticity*: But just having the rule of recognition is not
            enough. We also need to be able to deliberately introduce
            new rules or revise or repeal existing ones.
    
            -   For that, we need a different kind of secondary
                rules---*rules of change*.
    
            -   Note that the same rule can serve multiple functions.
                For example, "enactment by Congress" can be interpreted
                as both a rule of recognition and a rule of change.
    
        -   *Inefficiency*: There are no official agencies responsible
            for make "final and authoritative determinations" as to
            whether there has been a violation of a rule and for
            imposing sanctions for violation.
    
            -   A third kind of secondary rules---*rules of
                adjudication*---is needed to remedy this inefficiency.
                These rules empower certain individuals or agencies to
                adjudicate whether rules have been violated and to
                enforce the rules using sanctions.
    
            -   Often, rules of adjudication can also ground a rule of
                recognition: The judgments of the adjudicators are a
                source of rules.
    
-   *Hart's analysis of legal validity*: "To say that a given rule is
    valid is to recognize it as passing all the tests provided by the
    rule of recognition and so as a rule of the system."
    -   *Recognition*: What's at issue is whether a rule is
        *recognized*---from the internal point of view---as passing all
        the tests provided by the rule of recognition.
    
        -   This gives law the kind of normativity that Hart desires:
            Because people *recognize* a rule as passing all the tests
            provided by the rule of recognition and so as legally valid,
            they can recognize the rule as providing *reasons* for them
            to act in a certain way.
    
    -   It satisfies the Social Thesis: A given rule is legally valid
        entirely in virtue of the fact that it is recognized by those
        who fall under it as passing all the tests provided by the rule
        of recognition.
    
    -   It satisfies the Conceptual Separability Thesis: Moral
        requirements do not appear anywhere in Hart's analysis of legal
        validity.
