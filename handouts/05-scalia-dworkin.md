## Scalia's Originalism

-   We will discuss originalism here mostly as an approach to
    *constitutional* interpretation, whose competitor is living
    constitutionalism.
    -   We will come back to explain what living constitutionalism
        means.
    
    -   The public and many legal scholars often associate originalism
        (as a theory of constitutional interpretation) with conservative
        outcomes, and living constitutionalism with liberal outcomes.
    
        -   But even if there is association, it's unclear there is
            causation: it's just that most originalists are
            conservatives, and most living constitutionalists liberals (which then encourages conservatives to be originalists and liberals living constitutionalists).
    
        -   As we will see very soon, Dworkin can be construed as
            defending a liberal version of originalism.
    
-   Originalism comes in many different flavors. A popular family of
    originalism is what we might call "original intent originalism":

    -   *Original intent originalism*: In interpreting a constitutional
        text, we should look to the *original intent* of the framers.

    -   Original intent originalism itself has two variants:

        -   *Original subjective intent originalism*: In interpreting a
            constitutional text, we should look to the original
            *subjective* intent of the framers.
            -   Subjective intent = the actual intent of the framers
            
        -   *Original objective intent originalism*: In interpreting a
            constitutional text, we should look to the original
            *objective* intent of the framers.
            -   Objective intent = "the intent that a reasonable person
                would gather from the text of the law"
        
    -   Let's illustrate the distinction by modifying Dworkin's mink
        example (we are using a statute as an example here, but
        originalists often think their approach extends to statutory
        interpretation as well, so this shouldn't matter):
    
        -   "Suppose some legislature enacts a law forbidding the
            hunting of animals that are members of 'endangered species'
            and then, later in its term, imposes special license
            requirements for hunting, among other animals, minks."
    
        -   Suppose further that the law makers do have minks in mind
            when they pass the law to forbid the hunting of endangered
            animals, but are simply making a mistake when they include
            minks in the licensing law (they do not actually intend to
            allow hunting licenses for minks).
    
        -   An original *subjective* intent originalist would say
            hunting minks is prohibited because that is what the law
            makers actually, subjectively intend the law to mean.
    
        -   An original *objective* intent originalist, however, would
            disagree. They would think a reasonable person (not the law
            makers themselves) would take the law to mean minks are not
            endangered, and so hunting them is allowed as long as one
            gets a license.
    
    -   Justice Scalia rejects both original subjective intent
        originalism and original objective intent originalism.
    
        -   Scalia thinks original subjective intent originalism is
            problematic for two reasons:
    
            -   *Theoretical threat*: Interpreting constitutional texts
                according to the original subjective intent of the
                framers is undemocratic because the constitution ought
                to mean what is *promulgated*, not what the framers
                (privately?) intended in their heads.
    
            -   *Practical threat*: When judges interpret constitutional
                texts according to the original subjective intent of the
                framers, they have to substitute the original subjective
                intent of the framers with what they *think* the
                original subjective intent of the framers is. For
                Scalia, this runs the risk of judges "in fact
                pursu\[ing\] their own objectives and desires" under the
                disguise of the intent of the framers.
    
        -   Scalia finds original objective intent originalism
            problematic for a different reason: it mistreats "foolish
            statutes."
    
            -   Scalia uses a different example, but we can just work
                with our own mink example here: The licensing statute in
                our example is a badly-crafted law. However, an original
                objective intent originalist would try to fix it even at
                the *expense* of distorting its meaning. They would read
                the law as saying minks are not endangered and that mink
                hunting is not prohibited, even though it's a lot more
                reasonable to interpret the law as prohibiting mink
                hunting.
    
-   Scalia wants to defend a different flavor of originalism---a blend
    of originalism and *textualism*.

    -   Textualism contrasts with intent-based theories:

        -   *Textualism*: In interpreting constitutional texts, we
            should look to the *text*, not the intent of the framers.

    -   Combing textualism and originalism, we get what we might call
        "textualist originalism" (as opposed to original intent
        originalism):

        -   *Textualist originalism*: In interpreting constitutional
            texts, we should look to the *original meaning of the text*.

    -   Scalia distinguishes this flavor of originalism from a popular
        form of textualism called "strict constructionism":
        -   *Strict constructionism*: In interpreting constitutional
            texts, we should look to the *strict, literal meaning of the
            text*.
        
    -   Scalia thinks strict constructionism is "a degraded form of
        textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute."
        Indeed, he goes so far as to say, "I am not a strict
        constructionist, and no one ought to be."
    
        -   You might think this is surprising coming from perhaps one
            of the most well-known conservative justices in recent
            memory.
    
        -   Scalia's example is *Smith v. United States* (1993):
    
            -   In *Smith*, the petitioner tried to barter his MAC-10
                automatic weapon for cocaine. He was indicted under 18
                U.S.C. 924(c)(1) for "use\[\]" of a firearm "during and
                in relation to . . . \[a\] drug trafficking crime."
    
            -   For a "machinegun" or a gun "equipped with a firearm
                silencer," which the petitioner's weapon qualifies, the
                statute imposes a minimum sentence of 30 years.
    
            -   The petitioner argued that using a firearm as a medium
                of barter did not constitute a *use* of the firearm
                within the meaning of the statute.
    
            -   The Court disagreed: "By attempting to trade his MAC-10
                for the drugs, \[the petitioner\] 'used' or 'employed'
                it as an item of barter to obtain cocaine; he 'derived
                service' from it because it was going to bring him the
                very drugs he sought."
    
            -   Scalia takes the Court's reasoning to be illustrative of
                strict constructionism (though perhaps not all justices
                in the majority were strict constructionists): what the
                Court held was, to use a firearm as a medium of barter
                strict was a use of the firearm within the strict,
                literal meaning of the text of the statute.
    
            -   Scalia thinks the strict constructionist interpretation
                is unreasonable. Instead, he argues that using the
                firearm as a medium of barter is not a use of the
                firearm under the statute because it is not to use it as
                it is used *ordinarily*, that is, as a weapon.
    
        -   It's unclear, however, how this example can support his
            *originalism*. We should distinguish at least two varieties
            of textualism:
    
            -   *Original meaning textualism* (i.e., textualist
                originalism): In interpreting constitutional texts, we
                should look to the *original meaning of the text*.
    
            -   *Ordinary meaning textualism*: In interpreting
                constitutional texts, we should look to the *ordinary
                meaning of the text*.
    
        -   Although the ordinary meaning can coincide with the original
            meaning, it's possible for the two to diverge, given, for
            example, meaning can change over time.
    
            -   Perhaps, in this case, Scalia's claim is that the
                ordinary meaning just is the ordinary meaning.
    
            -   Still, this does not obviously provide a reason in
                support of his *originalism*, or original meaning
                textualism.
    
-   Now, Scalia makes the claim that we should prefer his brand of
    originalism to living constitutionalism.

    -   *Living constitutionalism*: The constitution "grows and changes
        from age to age, in order to meet the needs of a changing
        society."
        -   Scalia's skepticism: "No fewer than three of the Justices
            with whom I have served have maintained that the death
            penalty is unconstitutional, *even though its use is
            explicitly contemplated in the Constitution*. The Due
            Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments says
            that no person shall be deprived of life without due process
            of law; and the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment
            says that no person shall be held to answer for a capital
            crime without grand jury indictment. No matter. Under The
            Living Constitution the death penalty may have *become*
            unconstitutional" (his emphasis).
        
        -   Scalia thinks living constitutionalism is problematic most
            importantly because it implies the Constitution "means, from
            age to age, what \[the public think?\] it *ought to* mean"
            (my emphasis).
            -   "Should there be---to take one of the less controversial
                examples---a constitutional right to die? If so, there
                is. Should there be a constitutional right to reclaim a
                biological child put out for adoption by the other
                parent? Again, if so, there is. If it is good, it is
                so."

## Dworkin's Objections

-   Dworkin argues Scalia fails to appreciate the distinction between:

    -   *Semantic originalism*: In interpreting constitutional texts, we
        should look to what the framers *intended* the text to mean.

    -   *Expectation originalism*: In interpreting constitutional texts,
        we should look to what the framers *expected* the text to mean.

-   Dworkin's example: The boss says, "Hire the most qualified
    applicant." Unbeknownst to others, the boss thinks his son is the
    most qualified applicant.
    -   What the boss *intended* his order to mean: "Hire the most
        qualified applicant."
    
    -   What the boss *expected* his order to mean: "Hire my son, who is
        the most qualified applicant."
    
-   Dworkin's question for Scalia: Are you a semantic originalist, or
    are you an expectation originalist?
    -   Dworkin argues that Scalia cannot be an expectation originalist,
        otherwise he would not be "faithful to his textualism."
    
        -   This is because Scalia rejects both of the original intent
            variants of originalism. To be an expectation originalist is
            to smuggle the intent of the framers back in.
    
            -   Dworkin: "The law, as Scalia emphasizes, is what
                Congress has said, which is fixed by the best
                interpretation of the language it used, not by what some
                proportion of its members wanted or expected or assumed
                would happen, or would have wanted or expected or
                assumed if they had thought of the case."
    
    -   So, Scalia has to be a semantic originalist. But Dworkin argues
        semantic originalism contradicts how Scalia reads certain
        constitutional amendments. Here, we should clarify that Dworkin
        thinks, at least for certain constitutional provisions, there
        can be the following two "translations" or interpretations of
        the semantic intention of the text (that is, what the framers
        intended the text to mean). Let's illustrate them in the context
        of the 8th Amendment's prohibition against "cruel and unusual
        punishments."
    
        -   *Concrete and dated interpretation*: The specific
            "punishments widely regarded as cruel and unusual at the
            date of this enactment" are prohibited.
            -   These punishments are *concrete* (think of them as items
                on a list of specific punishments prohibited) and
                *dated* (no new punishments invented after the enactment
                of the 8th Amendment can be included).
            
        -   *Principled and moral interpretation*: "\[W\]hatever
            punishments are in fact cruel and unusual" are prohibited.
            -   This reading takes 8th Amendment to be a moral principle
                that is not dated. It is a *moral principle* because it
                prohibits a general type of punishments (not any
                specific, concrete punishments) identified in part by a
                bona fide moral criterion. And it is *not dated* because
                new punishments invented afterwards can still turn out
                to be cruel and unusual.
        
    -   Dworkin argues that the concrete and dated interpretation is
        indefensible for two reasons:

        -   "It is near inconceivable that sophisticated
            eighteenth-century statesmen, who were familiar with the
            transparency of ordinary moral language, would have used
            'cruel' as shorthand for 'what we now think cruel.' They
            knew how to be concrete when they intended to be: the
            various provisions for criminal and civil process in the
            Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Amendments do not speak of
            'fair' or 'due' or 'usual' procedures but lay down very
            concrete provisions. If they had intended a dated provision,
            they could and would have written an explicit one. Of
            course, we cannot imagine Madison or any of his
            contemporaries doing that: they wouldn't think it
            appropriate to protect what they took to be a fundamental
            right in such terms. But that surely means that the dated
            translation would be a plain mistranslation."
    
    -   If Dworkin is right, then either Scalia accepts the concrete and
        dated interpretation, which is indefensible, or Scalia accepts
        the principled and moral interpretation, which is inconsistent
        with what he says about various amendments.
    
        -   For example, Scalia thinks the 8th Amendment *certainly*
            permits the death penalty (see above). If Scalia accepts the
            principled and moral interpretation, Dworkin claims, Scalia
            cannot be so certain. The Framers could have been *wrong*
            about which punishments are in fact cruel and unusual, and
            we should defer to the timeless, abstract moral principle
            they enacted, not which specific punishments they *thought*
            at the time were cruel and unusual.
    
-   Dworkin's comments on Scalia inspired a new approach to reading the
    Constitution---reading it *morally*.

    -   Following Connie Rosati, it's helpful to distinguish Dworkin's
        own way of reading the Constitution morally and the general idea
        that (certain clauses of) the Constitution can and ought to be
        read morally.[^1]

        -   Rosati understands the general idea as: "When a constitution
            contains clauses that are framed in abstract moral terms,
            those clauses are to be understood as expressing general
            moral principles, and interpreters are to understand and
            apply those clauses accordingly" (327).

    -   Here, it is also helpful to have another distinction that's
        commonly used in philosophy: concept and conception.

        -   Different people may have different *conceptions* of the
            same concept.

        -   Consider, for example, the following two conceptions of the
            concept \<gender equality\> (or, different conceptions of
            the principle of gender equality):

            -   *Gender equality as elimination of differential treatment*: What gender
                equality requires is the elimination of *differential*
                treatment on the basis of gender.

            -   *Gender equality as equal social position*: What gender
                equality requires is the elimination of *social
                subordination* on the basis of gender.

        -   Both are conceptions of the concept \<gender equality\>, but
            they disagree on what gender equality demands:

            -   As we will discuss later on, people who understand
                gender equality as equal treatment might object to the
                public funding of abortion services on the grounds that
                it is gender-based differential treatment.

            -   But those who understand gender equality as equal social
                position might think instead that the public funding of
                abortion is permissible or even required by gender
                equality because it is necessary to ameliorate
                gender-based social subordination.

        -   Likewise, consider how the *Plessy* Court and the *Brown*
            Court seem to have different conceptions of the concept
            \<equal protection of the laws\>:

            -   For the *Plessy* Court, equal protection of the laws is
                compatible with racial segregation.

            -   But, for the *Brown* Court, it is not.

        -   According to this Dworkinian (though not necessarily
            Dworkin's) idea of reading the Constitution morally, when
            the Framers enacted the 14th Amendment, what they enacted
            was the *concept* \<equal protection of the laws\> (or, more
            naturally, the *principle* of equality protection of the
            laws), not their particular conception of that concept or
            principle.

            -   This is in part because the Framers used the general,
                abstract language. They didn't write, "equal protection
                of the laws *as we understand it*."

            -   Of course, the Framers of the 14th Amendment did not
                think equal protection of the laws would prohibit racial
                segregation---but that was their *conception* of equal
                protection of the laws.

            -   Indeed, we can read the *Brown* Court as rejecting the
                Framer's conception of equal protection of the laws as
                indefensible. This is, actually, a Dworkinian reader
                might think, a *good* thing for the Constitution: The
                Framers, of course, were not infallible. They could have
                been *wrong* about the meaning of equal protection of
                the laws. To enact the general principle/concept rather
                than one's own conception of the principle/concept shows
                a sort of moral and intellectual humility and, very
                importantly, allows the Constitution to reflect the
                moral learning that takes place in that society.

## What Kind of Originalist Is Scalia? Scalia's Response

-   Dworkin's three-way distinction:

    -   *Expectation originalism*: In interpreting constitutional texts,
        we should look to what the framers *expected* the text to mean.

    -   *Semantic originalism*: In interpreting constitutional texts, we
        should look to what the framers *intended* the text to mean.
        -   *Concrete and dated semantic intent*: In interpreting
            constitutional texts, we should look to what the framers
            intended the text to mean in a *concrete* and *dated* sense.
        
        -   *Principled and moral semantic intent*: In interpreting
            constitutional texts, we should look to what the framers
            intended the text to mean in a *principled* and *moral*
            sense.
    
-   The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause example:

    -   *Expectation originalism*: "punishments we take to be cruel and
        unusual"
        -   Dworkin thinks Scalia cannot be an expectation originalist
            given Scalia rejects original intent originalism.
        
    -   *Semantic originalism*: "punishments that are cruel and unusual"
        -   *Concrete and dated semantic intent*: "the specific
            punishments widely regarded as cruel and unusual at the date
            of this enactment"
            -   Dworkin thinks this variant of semantic originalism is
                not suitable (at least) for general and abstract clauses
                of the Constitution like the Cruel and Unusual
                Punishments Clause, which does not just prohibit a list
                of specific punishments but cruel and unusual
                punishments generally and abstractly.
            
        -   *Principled and moral semantic intent*: "whatever
            punishments that are in fact cruel and unusual"
            -   Dworkin thinks Scalia has to be a semantic originalist
                of the principled and moral sort.
    
-   Scalia concedes that his originalism must be semantic originalism,
    but he suggests there is a third way to be a semantic originalist,
    which let's call the "principled and dated semantic intent":

    -   *Principled and dated semantic intent*: In interpreting
        constitutional texts, we should look to what the framers
        intended the text to mean in a *principled* and *dated* sense.
        -   In other words, the text should be read as a *dated*
            principle, but not a *timeless* moral principle.
        
        -   In the 8th Amendment case, perhaps: "whatever punishments
            that fit what we consider cruel and unusual today."
        
            -   This allows Scalia to say new forms of punishment
                invented after the enactment of the 8th Amendment can be
                cruel and unusual because they could fit what was
                considered cruel and unusual at the time of the 8th
                Amendment's enactment.
        
            -   But it time-stamps the concept of cruel and unusual
                punishments: what was enacted was the 1791 conception of
                the principle.
    
-   Let's slow down a bit here and review all these differences by
    considering another example: does racial segregation violate equal
    protection of the laws?

    -   *Expectation originalism*: No, because the Framers of the 14th
        Amendment certainly didn't *expect* racial segregation to
        violate the equal protection of the laws.

    -   *Semantic originalism*:
        -   *Concrete and dated semantic intent*: No, because racial
            segregation was not widely regarded as violative of equal
            protection of the laws at the time of the 14th Amendment's
            enactment even though the Framers did intend to mean equal
            protection of the laws.
        
        -   *Principled and moral semantic intent*: Yes, because racial
            segregation in fact violates equal protection of the laws
            even if the Framers did not think so.
        
        -   *Principled and dated semantic intent*: Unclear?
            -   On the principled and dated semantic internet picture,
                the question is whether racial segregation is consistent
                with what was considered equal protection of the laws at
                the time of the 14th Amendment's enactment.
            
            -   Perhaps we can determine this through some sort of a
                thought experiment: *would* a reasonable person at the
                time of the 14th Amendment's enactment think racial
                segregation violates equal protection of the laws?
            
            -   You might think the answer is no, because a reasonable
                person at the time of the 14th Amendment's enactment
                would not think racial segregation violates equal
                protection of the laws.
            
            -   But Scalia says, "\[A\]s for the application of the
                Equal Protection Clause generally (which is what
                Professor Dworkin proceeds to address), he quite
                entirely mistakes my position. I certainly do not assert
                that it permits discrimination on the basis of age,
                property, sex, 'sexual orientation,' \[sic\] or for that
                matter even blue eyes and nose rings. Denial of equal
                protection on all of these grounds is prohibited---but
                that still leaves open the question of what constitutes
                a denial of equal protection. Is it a denial of equal
                protection on the basis of sex to have segregated
                toilets in public buildings, or to exclude women from
                combat? I have no idea how Professor Dworkin goes about
                answering such a question. I answer it on the basis of
                the 'time-dated' meaning of equal protection in 1868.
                Unisex toilets and women assault troops may be ideas
                whose time has come, and the people are certainly free
                to require them by legislation; but refusing to do so
                does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, because that
                is not what 'equal protection of the laws' ever meant."
            
            -   Scalia seems too sneaky here. Although it's not easy to
                pin him down, I think he would have to say racial
                segregation does not *constitute* a violation of equal
                protection of the laws given "the 'time-dated' meaning
                of equal protection in 1868." Does that mean *Brown* was
                wrongly decided? That would be quite something!
