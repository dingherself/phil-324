## Checklist

To earn a *check*, your discussion must adequately respond to the prompt by (1) covering all elements of the prompt, (2) demonstrating a clear grasp of the relevant course materials as applied to the case, and (3) showing a serious, good-faith effort to develop a thoughtful, reasoned, and structurally complete analysis of the case.

More specifically, here are the elements that make a satisfactory (check-level) discussion:

- *Motive*: The discussion should introduce the question asked by the prompt and offer an explicit answer (that is, the *thesis*) in response to the question;
- *Key Terms*: The discussion should establish and explain the relevant technical terms, rather than taking them for granted.
- *Evidence*: The discussion should integrate, mostly through paraphrases, both factual evidence from the case itself and textual evidence from our assigned readings at relevant places to help develop its analysis.
- *Analysis*: The discussion should make clear how the evidence it draws on in fact supports its claims; it should aim to articulate reasons, considerations, and principles that not just the author, but everybody should be expected to accept.
- *Sources*: The discussion should represent its sources accurately and mostly charitably.
- *Structure*: The discussion should follow a logical structure and employ sign-posting language at points of transition.
- *Style*: The discussion should be composed in largely clear and straightforward prose, with no more than occasional obscurities that impede understanding.

To earn a *check-plus*, your discussion must demonstrate *sophistication* by going over and beyond the expectations for a check in at least one significant way. For example,

- The discussion may craft a particularly insightful thesis that indicates a deep and nuanced grasp of the case and the course materials.
- The discussion may provide a particularly compelling argument for its thesis with an original example, idea, or application of a theory.
- The discussion may develop a particularly thoughtful analysis by demonstrating nuanced and careful awareness of, and where appropriate, engaging with, countervailing considerations, competing views, and additional complications.
- The discussion may be particularly well-executed: it is crystal clear, easy to follow, a joy to read, and yet thoughtful and nuanced.

## Death on the Shadow Docket (Modules 1–2)

***United States v. Higgs*, 141 S. Ct. 645 (2021)**

In class, we learned about the Supreme Court’s shadow docket and surveyed many of the worries it raises. One of the most striking uses of the shadow docket occurs in the Court’s disposition of stays of execution in death penalty cases.

These cases often ask disturbing questions about the cruelty of the execution method (for example, in one recent case, a prisoner argued that even death by a firing squad would be more humane), the denial of a spiritual leader in the execution room, the lack of advance notice of execution date and method, the cognitive capacity of the prisoner at the time of execution such that they may not understand why the government is trying to kill them, and so on. Once the execution is scheduled, counsel for the prisoner will file an emergency petition for a stay (i.e., pause) of the execution, which lower courts often grant. But the state will appeal, and the appeal will quickly work its way up to the Supreme Court. Then, on the shadow docket, the justices will essentially vote on whether or not to allow the state to execute the prisoner. 

As you might remember, during the last year of the Trump administration, the federal government briefly resumed executions for the first time in 17 years. For this case discussion, we will look at [*United States v. Higgs*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-927_i42k.pdf), the 13th and last of these federal executions. Like most cases on the Court’s shadow docket, the majority did not write an opinion to explain its decision to allow the federal government to execute Mr. Higgs. Justices Breyer and Sotomayor each wrote a dissent.

Please read the decision linked above (note the lack of reasoning from the majority; Justice Sotomayor’s dissent will give you more context). It seems that many of the problems with the Court’s disposition of stays of execution on its shadow docket are moral problems (that is, they are problems about what is right/wrong, just/unjust); at the same time, it seems that they do bear directly on the lawfulness of the execution (that is, they factor into whether the execution is legal/illegal, whether a court should allow the execution to go forward). **In this connection, please write a short essay (3–4 pages, double spaced) critically discussing how *Higgs* might shed light on the disagreement between legal positivism and natural law theory.** Be sure to review the [checklist](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions.md#checklist) above.

## Relief for Wrongful Convictions (Modules 3–4)

 ***Shinn v. Ramirez*, 596 U.S. 366, 142 S. Ct. 1718 (2022)**

The Suspension Clause in Article I of the Constitution provides:

> The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.

By issuing writs of habeas corpus, federal courts can order the release of unlawfully detained persons. Most relevant to our discussion here, this gives defendants convicted of a crime in state court a constitutional right to challenge the lawfulness of their state court conviction in federal court.

But this right was severely restricted by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). One of the restrictions concerns the introduction of new evidence. The provision in question, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2), prohibits federal courts from hearing even the evidence for a claim that the defendent “has failed to develop the factual basis of . . . in State court proceedings.”

In our case, Mr. Barry Jones’s trial attorneys were apparently so incompetent that they failed to investigate and present readily available evidence of Mr. Jones’s innocence, leading to his first-degree murder conviction and death sentence in the Pima County Superior Court here in Tucson, Arizona back in 1995. The Arizona Supreme Court subsequently affirmed. In the state post-conviction stage, Mr. Jones’s state-appointed post-conviction attorney—who apparently did not meet the minimum qualifications required by Arizona law—in turn failed to investigate the trial attorneys’ failure to investigate, resulting in the denial of post-conviction relief by Arizona state courts. Now, in the federal post-conviction stage, Mr. Jones’s federal habeas corpus attorneys were finally competent enough to realize the spectacular incompetence of his previous attorneys. They argued successfully before the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona that because Mr. Jones’s right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment was violated, he is entitled to habeas corpus relief. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit then upheld the federal district court’s consideration of the evidence that Mr. Jones’s trial and post-conviction counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective.

But the state argued that Section 2254(e)(2) prohibited the federal district court from doing just that. At oral argument before the U.S. Supreme Court, Arizona’s Solicitor General Brunn Roysden III went so far as to suggest that “even innocence is not enough” for getting around Section 2254(e)(2) and releasing Mr. Jones. In the consolidated cases that became *Shinn v. Ramirez*, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed, leaving Mr. Jones on Arizona’s death row.

For our purposes, we will focus on Mr. Jones’s case. But as you can already tell, even his case is very technically and procedurally complex. So, instead of reading the opinion itself, we will rely on the Strict Scrutiny podcast’s relatively accessible summary and commentary, which you can listen to [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ToyAfhItAl9NNXCL8g7bF) (the relevant segment starts at 04:18; a transcript is available [here](https://crooked.com/podcast/innocence-isnt-enough/)).

**After listening to the podcast episode, please write a short essay (3–4 pages, double spaced) critically discussing how, in your view, Hart, Fuller, and Dworkin would each analyze the legality of the federal district court’s decision to consider evidence that Mr. Jones’s trial and post-conviction counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective, in light of Section 2254(e)(2)’s restrictions, and do you think any of them would be right about that (why or why not)?** Be sure to review the [checklist](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions.md#checklist) above.

(P.S. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, Mr. Jones’s current attorneys, through truly outstanding advocacy, managed to reach a settlement agreement with the state and finally [secured his release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmM97a86kx5WtwxHkhtE1UBquNDcTxkrsWWUOl09B6o/edit) in June 2023, nearly three decades after his wrongful conviction.)

## One Burglary, or Ten? (Module 5)

***Wooden v. United States*, 595 U.S. 360, 142 S. Ct. 1063 (2022)**

On one evening in 1997, Mr. William Wooden broke into ten units at a storage facility right next to his house (see this [Google Maps photo](https://bit.ly/3sMQsKX) for what the storage facility is like—this turns out to be really important). He was subsequently indicted on ten counts of burglary, among other charges, and he pleaded guilty to all of them. He received a total sentence of eight years.

Now, fast forward to 2014. Mr. Wooden was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm (he contests the constitutionality of the police officers’ entry and search of his house that led to his arrest, but we will set that aside for our purposes). This crime carries a maximum sentence of ten years, and in Mr. Wooden’s case, the U.S. probation office recommended a sentence of 21 to 27 months within the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range, which meant Mr. Wooden would get to go home by the end of 2016.

The prosecutors, however, turned to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). ACCA mandates a fifteen-year *minimum* sentence for the felon-in-possession offense if the defendant “has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony . . . committed on occasions different from one another.” 18 U.S.C. §  924(e)(1). With the ACCA enhancement, Mr. Wooden would still be in prison until 2028.

After a jury convicted Mr. Wooden of being a felon in possession of a firearm, the district court agreed with the prosecutors that Mr. Wooden’s burglary of the ten units in the same storage facility on the same night amounted to not one, but ten prior qualifying offenses “committed on occasions different from one another,” triggering the fifteen-year sentencing enhancement under ACCA. The district court sentenced Mr. Wooden to 188 months’ imprisonment, and a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed. The *en banc* Six Circuit denied rehearing.

Mr. Wooden then filed a cert petition *on his own* (he then found attorneys to represent him), managing to get the Supreme Court to grant it. Writing for the Court, Justice Kagan found that the ten counts of burglary that Mr. Wooden was convicted of were not “committed on occasions different from one another” within the meaning of ACCA.

Please read (in this order):

- [Mr. Wooden’s *pro se* petition for certiorari](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-5279/149536/20200810135703871_20200810-135507-95751217-00000602.pdf): pp. 2–4, 8–11
- [Sixth Circuit opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-5279/149536/20200810135704092_20200810-135507-95751217-00000603.pdf): Appendix A, pp. 1–3, 8–11

**Then, in light of our discussion of statutory interpretation, please write a short essay (3–4 pages, double spaced) critically discussing how you think the phrase “committed on occasions different from one another” should be interpreted.** Be sure to review the [checklist](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions.md#checklist) above.

## Civil Disobedience in BLM (Module 6)

***Doe v. Mckesson*, 71 F.4th 278 (5th Cir. 2023), *petition for cert. filed*, No. 23-373 (U.S. Oct. 10, 2023)**

The materials in Module 6 focused on protests from the Civil Rights Movement, including the Supreme Court’s treatment of the Good Friday march in Birmingham, led by Dr. Martin Luther King. For this case discussion, we will look at how courts now approach civil rights protests.

After two officers of the Baton Rouge Police Department shot and killed Mr. Alton Sterling, a Black man, on July 5, 2016, the local community took to the streets. By all accounts, the protests were initially peaceful, but on July 9, an unknown person in the crowd threw a “rock-like” object at the police, which hit and injured an unnamed police officer, John Doe.

Mr. Deray Mckesson is a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, and helped organize the July 9 protest. But by all accounts, he was not the person who threw the rock-like object, nor did he encourage or authorize them to do it.

Still, Officer Doe sued Mr. Mckesson, not the actual thrower of the rock-like object, in federal court on a novel theory of negligence. Officer Doe argued that Mr. Mckesson should be held personally liable for the action of the rock-thrower because he “knew or should have known” that violence would occur, the First Amendment’s protections notwithstanding. While the district court dismissed Officer Doe’s claim, the Fifth Circuit reversed. Mr. Mckesson’s petition for certiorari is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Please read [the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in *Mckesson*](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/17/17-30864-CV4.pdf):

- The majority opinion, pp. 11–34;
- Judge Willett’s dissent, pp. 35–59.

**Then, in a short essay (3–4 pages, double spaced), please critically discuss how you imagine Rawls and King would respond to *Mckesson*—would either of them think the case was rightly decided, and would you agree with them (why or why not)?** Be sure to review the [checklist](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions.md#checklist) above.

## Gender-Based Citizenship Requirements (Modules 7–8)

***Sessions v. Morales-Santana*, 582 U.S. 47 (2017)**

A persistent doctrinal problem within the Court’s approach to gender equality is its treatment of purported real sex differences. In our discussion of MacKinnon, for example, we encountered the Court’s view on pregnancy: discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, *Geduldig* and *Gilbert* held, is not discrimination on the basis of sex because pregnancy is an inherent difference that’s unique but not universal to women.

Federal immigration law is another area where the Court has struggled with purported real sex differences. In a 2001 case, *Tuan Anh Nguyen v. Immigration and Naturalization Service*, the Court upheld a federal law imposing three additional citizenship requirements for a child born abroad to an unmarried citizen father and non-citizen mother, as compared to a child born abroad to an unmarried citizen mother and non-citizen father:

- The “blood relationship” must be “established by clear and convincing evidence.”
- The father must agree in writing “to provide financial support for the [child] until the [child] reaches the age of 18 years.”
- The paternity must also be formally recognized by the child’s 18th birthday.

Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy leaned on “the significant difference between [a mother’s and a father’s] relationships to the potential citizen at the time of birth” in two respects:

- First, while the “biological parent-child relationship” between the mother and the child “is verifiable from the birth itself,” the father “need not be present at the birth.”
- Second, while “the opportunity for a meaningful relationship between citizen [mother] and child inheres in the very event of birth,” such an “opportunity does not result from the event of birth, as a matter of biological inevitability, in the case of the unwed father.”

Both women then on the Court dissented. Justice O’Connor’s dissent strongly contested the majority’s assertion of “biological inevitability”:

- In response to the biological parent-child relationship argument, Justice O’Connor pointed out that “a mother will not always have formal legal documentation of birth because a birth certificate may not issue or may subsequently be lost. Conversely, a father’s name may well appear on a birth certificate. . . . [T]he majority has not shown that a mother’s birth relation is uniquely verifiable *by the INS*, much less that any greater verifiability warrants a sex-based, rather than a sex-neutral, statute.”
- And in response to the meaningful relationship argument, Justice O’Connor wrote that the argument “finds support not in biological differences but instead in a stereotype—i.e., ‘the generalization that mothers are significantly more likely than fathers . . . to develop caring relationships with their children.’”

The case we will discuss follows up on this 2001 decision. [*Sessions v. Morales-Santana* (2017)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1191_2a34.pdf) concerned another differential requirement:

- Federal immigration law confers citizenship to a child born abroad to a citizen parent *married* to a non-citizen parent if the citizen parent was physically present in the United States for 10 years (at least 5 of which must be after the citizen parent’s 14th birthday) prior to the child’s birth. The same physical presence requirement applies to a child born abroad to an *unmarried* citizen *father*.
- For unmarried citizen *mothers*, however, “a continuous period of one year” is sufficient for passing citizenship to their children born abroad.

This time, the Court found the differential requirement unconstitutional, but it got hung up on remedy: for the Court, Justice Ginsburg wrote that the right thing to do here was to strike down the shortened period for unmarried citizen mothers, such that the longer period would apply across the board—indeed, Justice Ginsburg argued that this was necessitated “by the legislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand.” In other words, in ruling *for* Mr. Morales-Santana (whose citizen father fell 20 days short of the 10-year physical presence requirement), the Court denied him the protection from deportation that he sought.

**Please read Justice Ginsburg’s majority opinion in *Morales-Santana* linked above (be smart about which parts to skim!). Then, please write a short essay (3–4 pages, double spaced) critically discussing how you think MacKinnon would respond to *Morales-Santana*—would MacKinnon believe the Court has reached the right result for the right reason, and would you agree with her (why or why not)?** Be sure to review the [checklist](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions.md#checklist) above.

## Discrimination against Older Women (Modules 9–10)

***Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk, LLC*, 966 F.3d 1038 (10th Cir. 2020)**

By now, we have introduced Crenshaw’s now-classic critique of the courts’ failure to conceptualize intersectional discrimination against Black women. We have also just considered two more intersectional forms of discrimination—sexual harassment (sex/gender, sexuality, and class) and LGBTQ+ discrimination (sex/gender, sexual orientatition, and gender identity).

While Crenshaw’s work has been extraordinarily influential in legal theory and beyond, courts are still struggling to catch up even three decades later. Since *Bostock*, however, legal scholars have wondered if the *Bostock*-style analysis could help with this uptake problem. For this case discussion, we will look at the 10th Circuit’s state-of-the-art analysis of employment discrimination on an intersectional sex-and-age basis. One particularly interesting aspect of the 10th Circuit’s analysis in [*Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk*](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/010110379793.pdf) is that the court held that intersectional sex-and-age discrimination could still violate Title VII even if the text of Title VII does not expressly include age as a protected characteristic.

*Frappied* is a very complex case, and you’ll want to keep close track of four different issues:

- The disparate treatment claim under Title VII;
- The disparate impact claim under Title VII;
- The disparate treatment claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA); and
- The disparate impact claim under ADEA.

The distinction between disparate treatment and disparate impact came up in MacKinnon’s discussion, but we didn’t formally introduce it. So let me give you a very rough overview: Disparate treatment and disparate impact are two standard theories in mainstream U.S. discrimination law for when something constitutes a case of discrimination. For there to be discrimination under the disparate treatment theory, the employer must *intentionally* treat similarly situated persons differently on the basis of a protected characteristic (e.g., age under ADEA or race/color/religion/sex/national origin under Title VII). In contrast, the disparate impact theory does not require a discriminatory intent. In Title VII cases, for example, an employment policy or practice that is “facially neutral” (i.e., not overtly discriminatory) can still violate Title VII if it *disproportionately affects* a protected group without being justified by a *business necessity*. The disparate impact theory is also available under ADEA. (But in *Washington v. Davis* (1976), the Supreme Court held that there is no disparate impact theory for racial discrimination claims under the Equal Protection Clause.)

**Please read the 10th Circuit’s opinion linked above. Then, please write a short essay (3–4 pages, double spaced) critically discussing whether you think the *Bostock*-style analysis, as illustrated by both *Bostock* itself and its application in *Frappied*, can provide an adequate solution to the analytical challenges posed by intersectional discrimination (be sure to consider countervailing reasons!).** Be sure also to review the [checklist](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions.md#checklist) above.

## Gender-Affirming Care (Modules 11–12)

***L.W. v. Skrmetti*, 83 F.4th 460 (6th Cir. 2023), *petition for cert. filed*, No. 23-466 (U.S. Nov. 1, 2023)**

Inspired by *Geduldig* and *Dobbs*, defendants in transgender discrimination cases have in the last few years come up with two novel defenses. I call these the “equal application” defense and the “unique application” defense in my own work. According to the equal application defense, transgender discrimination is not a case of sex discrimination because it applies equally to all transgender persons regardless of sex; and according to the unique application defense, discrimination against persons seeking gender-affirming care is not a case of transgender discrimination because only but not all transgender people seek gender-affirming care.

*L.W. v. Skrmetti* was one of the first cases to accept the equal application and unique application defenses of transgender discrimination, in a pair of cases challenging newly enacted state laws prohibiting gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The cases in this area are developing very fast. There is now a circuit split on the issue, and the Solicitor General is joining the trans kids in asking the Supreme Court to take up the case, so it seems quite likely that the Court may decide it as early as the summer of 2024.

**Please read [the 6th Circuit’s opinion in *Skrmetti*](https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/23a0221p-06.pdf). Then, please write a short essay (3–4 pages, double spaced) critically assessing the merits of the majority’s argument—do you think the majority got it right, and why or why not?** Be sure to review the [checklist](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions.md#checklist) above.
