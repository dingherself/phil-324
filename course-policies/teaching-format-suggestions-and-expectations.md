# Teaching Format, Suggestions, and Expectations

As our course will be delivered entirely online in an asynchronous format, it’s really important that you understand how the course works, how best to approach it, and what is expected of you.

## Note on Our Course Website

Unfortunately, the university’s D2L system is very awkward to set up in the way I want to for an asynchronous online course like ours. Although we will continue to use D2L for assignments and quizzes, I will be hosting our course materials—including all links to readings and lectures as well as all my notes—on [GitHub](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324). The GitHub interface will look a bit different from what you are used to, but I hope that, like me, you’ll find it a lot more intuitive and navigable than D2L.

I’m happy to help you troubleshoot technical issues. I understand how frustrating these things can be, but I would not be in a position to help if there weren’t enough time. So, please be proactive and ask for help early.

## Course Structure

Our course is divided into two parts, each of which consists of six modules. The first part (Modules 1–6) covers classic topics in general philosophy of law, and the second part (Modules 7–12) more recent topics in feminist philosophy of law. Both parts follow the same structure:

- The first three modules of each part introduce you to the general, theoretical debates, and the next three consider specific, applied issues that shed those theories in a different light.
- For each module, you are expected to do all assigned readings as you follow and complete the reading guide, watch all assigned lectures, and take the module quiz.
- Each part also has three or four case discussions, which invite you to examine the implications of the course materials for recent cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court and federal appellate courts.

You are required to complete any ten of the twelve modules and any four of the seven case discussions. However, some modules and case discussions will inevitably draw on materials covered in earlier modules. My suggestion is to complete all of Modules 1–3 and 7–9, any four of Modules 4–6 and 10–12, and then any four of the case discussions that are relevant to the modules you have elected (see here). You are welcome to complete more than the required modules for purposes of extra credit, as explained here.

There is no firm deadline by which you must complete each individual assignment. But you must complete all course requirements by the last day of class, January 9, 2024, unless you make special arrangements with me ahead of time—please contact me as soon as you can if you know you cannot complete the course on time. You can find a suggested schedule here.

## Workload

The university requires at least 135 hours of work by each student for a 3-credit course like ours, and so you should expect to spend an average of 13.5 hours working on every required module. I understand this is not a trivial time commitment. I also know you are already working incredibly hard by taking a winter course. I really want all of you to get the most out of this class. All the hours you spend reading, thinking, discussing, and writing will be rewarding in the end.

## Please Don’t Procrastinate!

Procrastination is probably the biggest impediment to success in an online course. **Please don’t wait until the last minute to rush through the course and seek help early.** The modular structure is in place to help you keep track of your progress, but most will still depend on your own efforts!

## Are You New to Philosophy or Law? (Welcome!!)

The readings assigned in this course are unique in that they are written by legally-minded philosophers and philosophically-minded legal scholars. For this reason, they can be challenging to read, especially if you are new to philosophy or law. It’s *okay* if you feel you don’t understand every word (a good dictionary is your friend!), or that you do understand every word but just can’t put them together in a way that makes sense, or that you more or less understand all the sentences but are still at sea about what exactly the author is saying or doing. These experiences are very common and not indicative of your potential to thrive in this class.

You should expect to read (at least certain parts of) the text more than once. Reading philosophy/law is not a talent we are born with; rather, it is a skill that has to be acquired through practice. There is a lot to learn just from the *process* of putting effort into making sense of these difficult readings. I hope you will find the reading guides particularly useful, and please never be afraid to come ask questions about passages you find puzzling!

## Support for Nontraditional Students

How to structure the course in a way that is friendly to students with work, family, and other responsibilities is something that’s been on my radar. But I still struggle to do better. If you are a nontraditional student, I’m very happy to explore adjustments and alternative arrangements that might make more sense for your schedule.

## Time Zone

Tucson does *not* observe Daylight Saving Time and uses [**Mountain Standard Time (MST)**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/tucson) all year round. MST is 7 hours behind the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-7). Please be careful that MST is *not* the same as Mountain Time (MT) or Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).
