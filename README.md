If I can choose to disobey civil law, I can choose to disobey physical law... That’s just simple algebra.” / Trout: “No... It’s NOT.” / Agnes: “Whatever... I’m going to go float free of gravity... Want to join me?” / Trout: “Nah... I promised my mom that I’d obey gravity.”

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of law in general and feminist philosophy of law in particular. We will consider several significant philosophical issues at the intersection of law and morality and explore their jurisprudential implications. Topics will include the nature of law, judicial discretion, constitutional and statutory interpretation, civil disobedience, racial equality, gender equality, sexual harassment, reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ+ equality.

*A note on my lecture videos*: I recorded most of these lectures in the summer of 2021. Back then we understood that a series of cases—most notably, cases implicating reproductive autonomy and transgender discrimination—were on the horizon. Still, in retrospect, it’s shocking how much of the legal landscape has shifted—and how quickly and how radically it has shifted—in just two short years. I taught, as the law transformed, two lower division courses that engaged these issues extensively. But coming back to this course, I’m finding it rather difficult to sit down in front of a camera and record new lectures to incorporate the new developments in the law as they bear on our course. Instead of updating the course through new videos, then, I plan to write a few (hopefully, short) notes to supplement my 2021 lectures. I hope you will understand my decision here.

*Extra credit opportunity*: The University of Arizona is home to the annual Arizona Feminist Philosophy Graduate Conference (FemPhilAZ), organized by graduate students in our own philosophy department. The recordings of many talks in the past are available freely on the [conference website](https://www.femphilaz.com). You can earn up to 3 extra credit points on your final exam by watching any of the talks and writing a 1–2 page response paper. You should spend roughly half of your response paper summarizing the argument presented in the talk and then the other half critically engaging with it (e.g., raise a problem, defend it against a worry, connect it to an idea or argument we discussed in class, apply it to a different context). A couple of talks that are particularly relevant to this class include Professor Connie Rosati’s 2020 keynote on *Obergefell* (the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case that declared bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional), Professor Gina Schouten’s 2021 keynote on liberal feminism, and Joan O’Bryan’s 2022 paper on Beauvoir, MacKinnon, and Butler. But you should feel free to pick any other one that you find interesting!
