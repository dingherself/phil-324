## Course Overview and Objectives

What is the relationship between law and morality? Can a morally indefensible law nevertheless be legally valid? Is civil disobedience ever justifiable, and if so, under what circumstances? When judges interpret the law, do they follow moral principles even if those principles may have never been enacted into the law by a legislature? Should they? Are there cases where the law just “runs out,” and if so, how should judges decide them? Or, is there always a right answer as to how a case should be decided, distinguishable from the final answer given by a court of last resort such as the U.S. Supreme Court?

In this course, we will survey leading answers to these questions from the philosophy of law and consider their jurisprudential implications for a variety of issues central to feminist, antiracist legal theory. Our focus will be the interpretation and application of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment:

- First, we will consider the arguments behind the Supreme Court’s landmark holdings in *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954) that the racial segregation of public education is inherently unequal, and in *Loving v. Virginia* (1967) that a state law criminalizing interracial marriage violates both the equal protection and due process requirements of the 14th Amendment.
- Next, we will examine and critically assess the development of the Court’s gender equality jurisprudence under the 14th Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We will attend especially to ways in which gender inequality may be obscured by a lack of appreciation of intersectional discrimination and structural subordination. To illustrate intersectional discrimination, we will look at the Court’s recent holding in *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020) that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is necessarily sex discriminatory and thus violates Title VII. As for structural subordination, we will turn to Catharine MacKinnon’s extraordinarily influential argument that the sexual harassment of women workers constitutes a case of sex discrimination in employment.
- Finally, we will try to apply these important insights to two rapidly developing areas of law—reproductive and transgender rights. We will discuss the Court’s reproductive rights cases from *Griswold* to *Roe*, to *Casey*, and now to *Dobbs*, with an emphasis on the connection between due process and equal protection. We will then conclude by considering some leading (and ongoing) cases challenging transgender discrimination.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

My expectations are, at the conclusion of this course, you will be able to

1. Explain the disagreement between natural law theory, legal positivism, and legal interpretivism on the relationship between law and morality;
2. Illustrate various aspects of the relationship between law and morality in the contexts of judicial discretion, constitutional and statutory interpretation, civil disobedience, racial equality, gender equality, sexual harassment, reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ+ equality;
3. Charitably interpret and critically assess philosophical texts and arguments;
4. Compose a well-reasoned, original analysis that responds to a philosophical issue at the intersection of law and morality;
5. Discuss how philosophical reflection may shed light on contested moral and legal issues in a divided contemporary society such as the United States;
6. Discuss how conceptual tools may help to clarify and express minority experiences that are otherwise masked by oppressive social structures.

Phil 324 is cross-listed in Political Science and Public Administration & Policy.

## Required Texts

I will make all required readings available digitally. If there are any barriers (technical, etc.) that make it difficult for you to access any of the readings, please don’t be afraid to let me know.

## Course Structure, Suggestions, and Expectations

As our course will be delivered entirely online in an asynchronous format, it’s really important that you understand how the course works, how best to approach it, and what is expected of you.

### Note on Our Course Website

Unfortunately, the university’s D2L system is very awkward to set up in the way I want to for an asynchronous online course like ours. Although we will continue to use D2L for assignments and quizzes, I will be hosting our course materials—including all links to readings and lectures as well as all of my notes—on [GitHub](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324). The GitHub interface will look a bit different from what you are used to, but I hope that, over time, you’ll find it very intuitive to navigate.

I’m happy to help you troubleshoot technical issues. I understand how frustrating these things can be, but I would not be in a position to help if there weren’t enough time. So, please be proactive and ask for help early.

### Course Structure

Our course is divided into two parts, each of which consists of six modules. These two parts follow both a topical and a methodological logic:

- Part I (Modules 1–6) covers classic issues in general philosophy of law, and Part II (Modules 7–12) more recent issues in feminist philosophy of law.
- As we move from Part I to Part II, we will also transition from thinking about the law from the comfort of the philosopher’s armchair to more empirically engaged inquires characteristic of recent work in feminist legal theory.

Each part follows its own internal structure:

- The first three modules (the “foundational” modules) of each part introduce you to the big questions that animate the theoretical discussions, and the next three (the “applied” modules) consider specific, applied cases that put those discussions in an interestingly different light. For each part, you are required to complete all three foundational modules and any two of the three applied modules.
- For each required module, you are expected to do all assigned readings as you follow and complete the reading guide, watch all assigned lectures, and take the module quiz.
- Each part also includes several curated case discussions, which offer opportunities for you to critically examine the implications of the course materials for recent cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and federal appellate courts. You are required to complete one case discussion from each part.

There is no firm deadline by which you must complete each individual module. But you must complete all course requirements by **the last day of class, January 9, 2024**, unless you make special arrangements with me ahead of time—please contact me as soon as you can if you suspect you cannot complete the course on time.

[Please click here for a suggested schedule.](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/schedule.md)

### Workload

The university requires at least 135 hours of work by each student for a 3-credit course like ours, and so you should expect to spend an average of 13.5 hours working on each required module. Around a fourth will be so-called “contact hours”—that is, watching recorded lectures and discussing with the instructor. The rest will be spent on readings and assignments.

I understand this is not a trivial time commitment. I also know you are already working incredibly hard by taking a winter course. I really want all of you to get the most out of this class. All the hours you spend reading, thinking, discussing, and writing will be rewarding in the end.

### Are You New to Philosophy or Law? (Welcome!!)

The readings assigned in this course are unique in that they are written by legally-minded philosophers and philosophically-minded legal scholars. For this reason, they can be challenging to read, especially if you are new to philosophy or law. It’s *okay* if you feel you don’t understand every word (a good dictionary is your friend!), or that you do understand every word but just can’t put them together in a way that makes sense, or that you more or less understand all the sentences but are still at sea about what exactly the author is saying or doing. These experiences are to be expected and not indicative of your potential to thrive in this class.

You should expect to read (at least certain parts of) the text more than once. Reading philosophy/law is not a talent we are born with; rather, it is a skill that has to be acquired through practice. There is a lot to learn just from the *process* of putting effort into making sense of these difficult readings. I hope you will find the reading guides particularly useful, and please never be afraid to come ask questions about passages you find puzzling!

### Support for Nontraditional Students

How to structure the course in a way that is friendly to students with work, family, and other responsibilities is something that’s been on my radar. But I still struggle to do better. If you are a nontraditional student, I’m very happy to explore adjustments and alternative arrangements that might make more sense for your schedule.

### Time Zone

Tucson does *not* observe Daylight Saving Time and uses [**Mountain Standard Time (MST)**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/tucson) all year round. MST is 7 hours behind the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-7). Please be careful that MST is *not* the same as Mountain Time (MT) or Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).

### Please Don’t Procrastinate!

Procrastination is probably the biggest impediment to success in an online course. **Please don’t wait until the last minute to rush through the course and seek help early.** The modular structure is in place to help you keep track of your progress, but most will still depend on your own efforts!

## Assessment

This winter session will be the fifth time I’m teaching the online version of this course, and a lesson I’ve learned but never figured out how best to implement is that the assessment tools useful for an in-person, discussion-based philosophy course do not work as well for our asynchronous, lecture-heavy format.

This time, though, I’d like to try out a “build your own grade” system. My motivation here is that I want to create space for my students to genuinely learn and grow as philosophers, and I hope to do that by making grading as least anxiety-inducing as possible for students who are learning about law and philosophy for the first time. Here is how the system works:

- All of the assignments in this class will be graded on a check-plus/check/check-minus (i.e., excellent/satisfactory/unsatisfactory) basis. You will receive a check on an assignment as long as you complete it as instructed; a check-plus will ask you to put in a lot more effort, and I will explain what that amounts to for each type of assignments below.
- To earn a certain letter grade in the course (A, B, C …), you must complete all of the requirements for that letter grade as specified below.
- If you barely fail to meet the requirements for the next letter grade, you may choose to complete an extra credit assignment, described below, in order to make up for the missed requirement.

If at any point you have any questions about the logistics of the course, please don’t be afraid to reach out!

A grade of E/F will be assigned in cases where a student, in the instructor’s judgment,

1. fails to satisfy one or more of the requirements for a D in the course;
4. fails egregiously to demonstrate respect, support, and care for their classmates and instructor through actions that threaten the safety of the class or otherwise seriously disrupt the classroom environment; *or*
5. fails egregiously to comply with course and/or university policies, such as the [course policy on academic integrity](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/syllabus.md#academic-integrity) as stated below.

### Reading Guides

The **reading guides** are designed to walk you through the assigned readings by pointing you to the key concepts, distinctions, claims, and argumentative steps. Occasionally, I will also use the reading guides to explain the relevant philosophical or historical background. As you do the readings, please follow the questions on the reading guide and identify the relevant passages in the text that address them.

Some of the reading guide questions are **bolded**. If a question is bolded, you are asked to write out a brief answer in your own words (unless instructed otherwise). You don’t need to answer the question correctly in order to receive a *check*, but it must demonstrate at least serious, good-faith effort. You should not leave a bolded question unanswered, and you should never copy directly from my handouts—doing so does not show that *you* have tried to understand the reading. If a question is not bolded, you don’t need to answer it for purposes of a check.

To earn a *check-plus* on a reading guide, you are asked to

1. write the page numbers of the relevant passages next to the unbolded questions;
2. leave questions/comments/reactions to the reading as you answer the reading guide questions; and
3. go back to the reading guide after watching my lectures and revise your answers (please leave your original answer as is and use a different color or font to clearly identify the revision).

### Module Quizzes

For each module, there will be a **quiz** consisting of ten multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blanks, and/or matching questions. The purpose of the module quizzes is to check your understanding; they are not meant to be tricky. You will need to earn an 80% to receive a *check* on a quiz, and a 90% to receive a *check-plus*. I have set up D2L in such a way that if you receive at least a 60% but less than a 90%, you will automatically receive an opportunity to re-answer the questions you got wrong the first time.

### Case Discussions

The **case discussions** offer opportunities to apply what you have learned in class to current issues in the law in ways that build on but go beyond the lecture. You are asked to discuss two of the seven following cases—one from Part I (Modules 1–6) and one from Part II (Modules 7–12).

1. *United States v. Higgs* (2021): this is one of a very disturbing series of death penalty cases that the Supreme Court disposed of on its shadow docket. (Modules 1 and 2)
2. *Shinn v. Ramirez* (2022): the Court upheld the death sentences of two Arizona men despite evidence that their trial counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective, because their post-conviction counsel was also too unconstitutionally ineffective to raise the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. (Modules 3 and 4)
3. *Wooden v. United States* (2022): the Court considered whether burgling ten storage units at the same storage facility on the same night amounts to not one, but ten different offenses that are “committed on occasions different from one another,” thereby triggering a 15-year mandatory sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) when the petitioner was later convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. (Module 5)
4. *Doe v. Mckesson* (5th Cir. 2023): the 5th Circuit decided that the organizer of a Black Lives Matter protest could be held liable for the injuries of a police officer even though he did not cause those injuries himself. (Module 6)
5. *Sessions v. Morales-Santana* (2017): Justice Ginsburg, for the Court, struck down a sex discriminatory federal immigration statute but still rejected the petitioner’s citizenship claim. (Modules 7 and 8)
6. *Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk* (10th Cir. 2020): the 10th Circuit considered a claim of employment discrimination on an intersectional “sex-plus-age” basis. (Modules 9 and 10)
7. *L.W. v. Skrmetti* (6th Cir. 2023): the 6th Circuit rejected 14th Amendment challenges to state laws prohibiting gender-affirming care for transgender youth. (Modules 11 and 12)

I will provide instructions for each case discussion. To earn a *check*, you must adequately answer the question asked by the prompt, and to earn a *check-plus*, your discussion must demonstrate sophistication by going over and beyond the expectations for a check in at least one significant way. I explain what each of these entails in the [checklist for the case discussion assignment](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/case-discussions/00-checklist.md).

### Extra Credit Assignments

#### FemPhilAZ

Each year, graduate students here at the UA Department of Philosophy organize   the only regular feminist philosophy graduate conference in the world—the annual [Arizona Feminist Philosophy Graduate Conference](https://www.femphilaz.com/) (FemPhilAZ). Many of the talks at FemPhilAZ bear closely on the materials and topics of this class.

You can earn a 10% extra credit on two of your module quizzes by watching any of the FemPhilAZ talks (linked above on the conference website), writing a 1–2 page response paper, and emailing it to me by 11:59pm on Sunday, January 7, 2024. You should spend roughly half of your response paper summarizing the argument presented in the talk and then the other half critically engaging with it (you can, for example, raise a problem, defend it against a worry, connect it to an idea or argument we discussed in class, or apply it to a novel context).

Talks that are particularly relevant to our course include Professor Connie Rosati (now of UT Austin)’s 2020 keynote on *Obergefell* (the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case that declared bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional), Professor Gina Schouten (Harvard)’s 2021 keynote on liberal feminism, RJ Krabbendam (Tilburg)’s 2021 talk on affective injustice, and Joan O’Bryan (Stanford)’s 2022 paper on Beauvoir, MacKinnon, and Butler. But you should feel free to pick whichever talk you find most interesting!

#### Revising First Case Discussion

If you did not receive a check or a check-plus on your *first* case discussion, you will have the option to submit a revision in light of the feedback received. The revision must be *substantial* (it’s not enough to simply change a few words here and there), and it must be accompanied by a *revision cover letter*, in which you will have the opportunity to elaborate on how the revision has addressed and incorporated the feedback.

If you decide to revise your first case discussion, you must submit the revised version, along with the cover letter, by **the last day of class, January 9, 2024**. Note that if you turn in your first case discussion too close to that deadline, I may not have the chance to provide feedback in time for your revision in the first place.

#### Completing Extra Modules

You may choose to complete more than the ten required modules, in which case only the ten highest grades you receive on the reading guides and quizzes will count for purposes of the letter grade requirements. But note that you must submit a completed reading guide in order to take the quiz, and that you must do so by the last day of class, January 9, 2024.

## Academic Integrity

### Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See <http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity>.

### Plagiarism

**I view plagiarism as a *very* serious violation of the university’s Code of Academic Integrity, and you should as well.** I strongly encourage you to review this helpful guide prepared by the university library: <https://new.library.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism>. I understand different instructors may draw the line somewhat differently; if you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism for the purposes of our course, please don’t hesitate to ask me.

### Inappropriate Use of Class Notes and Course Materials

**Disseminating class notes or course materials beyond the classroom community, such as selling them to other students or to a third party for resale, is strictly prohibited.** Violations to this rule are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA email to sell or buy such notes or course materials are subject to Student Code of Conduct violations for misuse of student email addresses. This misconduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

## (Lack of) Diversity in Philosophy

Unfortunately, philosophy as an institutionalized discipline is remarkably white, cis male, straight, able-bodied, and middle-class. This lack of diversity is often apparent just from the topics and authors typically taught in introductory philosophy courses. However, philosophy as a whole is becoming more and more diverse thanks to the efforts of several generations of philosophers. As a philosophy student, you can also help the profession address its diversity and inclusiveness problems by seriously engaging with minority authors and supporting your fellow minority students.

The American Philosophical Association (APA) has a useful handout for minority undergraduate students in philosophy, which you can read here: <https://www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/diversity/Advice_for_Undergrads.pdf>.

A valuable local opportunity is the Arizona Feminist Philosophy Graduate Conference organized annually by graduate students at the UA Department of Philosophy. The conference brings together graduate students working on feminist issues from around the country and the world. The recordings of many talks in the past are available freely on the conference website: <https://femphilaz.com>.

## Respect, Support, and Care for One Another

### Materials in This Course

Since many of the issues we will cover in this course are not only intellectually but also personally relevant, you might find it difficult to read and discuss certain course materials. I want to acknowledge that. It’s perfectly understandable.

It’s therefore important that we *respect*, *support*, and *care for* one another throughout the course. Please always feel free to talk to me if you anticipate certain topics will be especially difficult for you, or if you think the way they get discussed in the class is disrespectful or otherwise problematic.

### How to Respect, Support, and Care for One Another

Here are some concrete examples of how you can respect, support, and care for your classmates and instructor:

- Value everyone’s contribution to class discussions;
- Disagree in a way that takes other people’s ideas seriously and sincerely;
- Challenge remarks, jokes, and examples that are racist, sexist, heterosexist, cissexist, misogynistic, transmisogynistic, xenophobic, ableist, ageist, classist, etc.;
- Keep discussions inclusive by avoiding talking to only a few specific people;
- Be mindful of how your tone/meaning might not be accurately conveyed through your writing alone (for example, if your question might be misunderstood as a rhetorical one, it’s probably a good idea to indicate explicitly that it is a genuine question);
- Please use your go-by name as your display name and, *if* you feel comfortable and safe doing so, include your pronouns as well;
- Use the pronouns and name you are asked to when you refer to a person, and avvoid assuming a person’s pronouns, gender identity, or sexual orientation based on their appearance, voice, or name;
- Be careful not to disclose anyone’s gender identity or sexual orientation (i.e., out them) without their permission, even if they are already out in the classroom—it can put lives in danger;
- Never inquire about anyone’s genitalia, deadname, “before” photos, medical history, assigned gender at birth, sex life, and so on;
- Use inclusive language (for helpful examples, see <https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist> and <https://transjournalists.org/style-guide>).

If you feel any aspect of this course makes it difficult for you to participate fully, I want to know. This is *very* important to me.

### University Statements on Discrimination, Harassment, and Threatening Behavior

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimi-nation. In support of this commitment, the University prohibits discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex, national ori-gin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information. For more information, including how to report a concern, please see <http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy>.

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See <http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students>.
