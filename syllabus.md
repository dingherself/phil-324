## Course Overview and Objectives

What is the relationship between law and morality? Can a morally indefensible law ever be legally valid? Is civil disobedience ever justifiable, and if so, under what circumstances? When judges interpret the law, do they follow moral principles even if those principles may have never been enacted into the law by a legislature? Should they? Are there ever cases where the law just “runs out,” and if so, how should judges decide them? Or, is there always a right answer as to how a case should be decided, distinguishable from the final answer given by a court of last resort such as the U.S. Supreme Court?

In this course, we will survey leading answers to these questions from the philosophy of law and consider their jurisprudential implications for a variety of issues central to feminist, antiracist legal theory. Our focus will be the interpretation and application of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment:

- First, we will consider the arguments behind the Supreme Court’s landmark holdings in *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954) that the racial segregation of public education is inherently unequal, and in *Loving v. Virginia* (1967) that a state law criminalizing interracial marriage violates both the equal protection and due process requirements of the 14th Amendment.
- Next, we will examine and critically assess the development of the Court’s gender equality jurisprudence under the 14th Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We will attend especially to ways in which gender inequality may be obscured by a lack of appreciation of intersectional discrimination and structural subordination. To illustrate intersectional discrimination, we will look at the Court’s very recent holding in *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020) that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity necessarily is sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. As for structural subordination, we will turn to Catharine MacKinnon’s extraordinarily influential argument that the sexual harassment of women constitutes a case of sex discrimination.
- Finally, we will try to apply these important insights to two rapidly developing areas of law—reproductive freedom and transgender equality. We will discuss the Court’s cases from *Griswold* to *Roe*, to *Casey*, and now to *Dobbs*, with an emphasis on the connection between due process and equal protection. We will then conclude by considering some leading and ongoing cases challenging transgender discrimination.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

My expectations are, at the conclusion of this course, you will be able to

1. Explain the disagreement between natural law theory, legal positivism and legal interpretivism on the relationship between law and morality;
2. Illustrate various aspects of the relationship between law and morality in the contexts of judicial discretion, constitutional and statutory interpretation, civil disobedience, racial equality, gender equality, sexual harassment, reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ+ equality;
3. Charitably interpret and critically assess philosophical texts and arguments;
4. Compose a well-reasoned, original analysis that responds to a philosophical issue at the intersection of law and morality;
5. Discuss how philosophical reflection may shed light on contested moral and legal issues in a divided contemporary society such as the United States;
6. Discuss how conceptual tools may help to clarify and express minority experiences that are otherwise masked by oppressive social structures.

Phil 324 is cross-listed in Political Science and Public Administration & Policy.

## Required Texts

- Catharine A. MacKinnon, *Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination*, Yale University Press, 1976. Paperback, 9780300022995. (Please be sure to look for used copies! We will start discussing the book in Week 4.)

I will make all other required readings available digitally. If there are any barriers (technical, financial, etc.) that make it difficult for you to access any of the readings, please don’t be afraid to let me know.

## Teaching Format, Suggestions, and Expectations

As our course will be delivered entirely online in an asynchronous format, it’s really important that you understand how the course works, how best to approach it, and what is expected of you.

### Github Website

Unfortunately, I find the university’s D2L system extraordinarily awkward to use for an asynchronous online course. I’m hosting most course materials—including all links to lectures, all my notes, and most readings—on Github (<https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324>).

Some readings, however, are not in the public domain. I will upload these to a shared class Box folder (https://arizona.box.com/s/gpv6oqrj6ih2iejs76tj55mdv2g4yf0j). You will need to log in using your UofA account in order to access them.

I’m happy to help you troubleshoot technical issues. I understand how frustrating these things can be, though I would not be able to help if there weren’t enough time. So, please be proactive and don’t wait until close to a deadline to ask for help.

### Course Structure

Our course is divided into 12 modules, each of which is roughly equivalent to two to three classes in the semester-long, synchronous version of this course. I tried to distribute the workload more or less evenly, but some modules still ended up longer than others.

**Two modules are assigned each week for the first six weeks of the course.** During Week 7, you will be asked to complete a take-home final exam. For each module, you are expected to:

- Do all assigned readings as you follow and fill out the reading guide;
- Watch all assigned lectures; and
- Participate in the weekly case discussion.

There is no firm deadline by which you must do the readings and watch the lectures. However, the reading guides, case discussions, and all other assignments have specific due dates.

If there are circumstances that prevent you from participating in the course or meeting certain deadlines, please don’t be afraid to let me know. My policy on late assignments, extensions, and make-ups is explained [below](#late-assignments-extensions-and-make-ups).

### Discord Server

This semester, I want to try out the idea of using a Discord server as our shared virtual classroom and social space. On Discord, you can connect with other students, discuss course materials, study together, ask me quick questions (for questions that require long answers, it’s often better to set up an appointment with me), and video/voice conference. My hope is that the Discord server can help bring the class together as a community even though we are all online and scattered all over the world.

I will post the link to join our Discord server on D2L.

### Optional Virtual Coffee Breaks

In addition to individual office hours by appointment, I will host a virtual coffee break every week. The coffee break is exactly what it sounds like: it’s a coffee break, not another lecture. It’s also strictly optional. I will be there to answer any questions you might have or just to chat more about something that caught your interest. I will circulate a doodle poll at the start of the course to get a sense of what might work for different students, and I will try to rotate the days/times so that as many people as possible can participate.

### Are You New to Philosophy or Law? (Welcome!!)

The readings assigned in this course are unique in that they are written by legally-minded philosophers and philosophically-minded legal scholars. For this reason, they can be challenging to read, especially if you are new to philosophy or law. It’s *okay* if you feel you don’t understand every word (a good dictionary is your friend!), or that you do understand every word but just can’t put them together in a way that makes sense, or that you more or less understand all the sentences but are still at sea about what exactly the author is saying or doing. These experiences are very common and not indicative of your potential to thrive in this class.

You should expect to read (at least certain parts of) the text more than once. Reading philosophy/law is not a talent we are born with; rather, it is a skill that has to be acquired through practice. There is a lot to learn just from the *process* of putting effort into making sense of these difficult readings. I hope you will find the reading guides particularly useful, and please never be afraid to come to office hours to discuss passages you find puzzling!

### Workload

The university requires at least 135 hours of work by each student for a 3-credit course like ours, and so you should expect to spend an average of 20 hours every week working on this course. Around a third of these will be so-called “contact hours”—that is, watching recorded lectures and discussing with your peers and the instructor. The rest will be spent on readings and assignments.

I understand this is not a trivial time commitment. I also know you are already working incredibly hard by taking a summer course. What I really hope to see, then, is that all of you will be able to get the most out of this class. All the hours you spend reading, thinking, discussing, and writing will be rewarding in the end.

### Please Don’t Procrastinate!

Procrastination is probably the biggest impediment to success in an online course. Given the fast pace of our 7-week format, there may be little time for you to catch up if you fall behind. **Please do all the readings, don’t wait until the last minute to rush through the lectures, remember to turn in assignments on time, and seek help early.** The modular structure is in place to help you keep track of your progress, but most will still depend on your own efforts!

### Time Zone

Tucson does *not* observe Daylight Saving Time and uses [**Mountain Standard Time (MST)**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/tucson) all year round. MST is 7 hours behind the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-7). Please be careful that MST is *not* the same as Mountain Time (MT) or Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).

### Support for Nontraditional Students

How to structure the course in a way that is friendly to students with work, family, and other responsibilities is something that’s been on my radar. But I still struggle to do better. If you are a nontraditional student, I’m very happy to explore adjustments and alternative arrangements that might make more sense for your schedule.

## Assessment

### Grade Components

- Reading Guides (30%)
- Case Discussions (25%)
- Take-Home Final Exam (45%)

You must complete the take-home final exam with at least a passing grade in order to pass this course. **An F received on any work due to academic dishonesty is grounds for an F in the course.**

### Reading Guides

The reading guides are designed to walk you through the assigned readings by helping you identify the key concepts, distinctions, claims, and argumentative steps. Occasionally, I will use the reading guides to explain some relevant philosophical and historical background. As you do the readings, please follow the questions on the reading guide and identify the relevant passages in the text that address them.

Some of the reading guide questions are **bolded**. If a question is bolded, please write out a brief answer. If a question is not bolded, you don’t need to answer it, but you are encouraged to write the page number of the relevant passage next to the question on the reading guide (doing so will make it easier for you to locate the passage later).

Please feel free to leave questions and comments for me as you answer the reading guide questions. Do keep in mind that Word’s commenting function is not supported by the D2L grading tool, so always write directly in the main text itself.

I will create a reading guide for each module. The reading guides are due each **Sunday by 11:59pm**, and they will together make up 30% of your final grade.

### Case Discussions

For each week we have new course content, we will try to apply what we have learned in class to a recent or current case in ways that build on but go beyond the lectures. The cases are as follows:

1. *United States v. Higgs* (2021): this is one of a very disturbing series of death penalty cases that the Supreme Court disposed of on its shadow docket.
2. *Shinn v. Ramirez* (2022): the Court upheld the death sentences of two Arizona men despite evidence that their trial counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective, because their post-conviction counsel was also too unconstitutionally ineffective to raise the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.
3. *Wooden v. United States* (2022): the Court considered whether burgling ten storage units at the same storage facility on the same night amounts to not one, but ten different offenses that are “committed on occasions different from one another,” thereby triggering a 15-year mandatory sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) when the petitioner was later convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm.
4. *Sessions v. Morales-Santana* (2017): Justice Ginsburg, for the Court, struck down a sex discriminatory federal immigration statute but still rejected the petitioner’s citizenship claim.
5. *Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk* (10th Cir. 2020): the 10th Circuit considered a claim of employment discrimination on an intersectional “sex-plus-age” basis.
6. *Toomey v. Arizona*, No. 19-cv-35 (D. Ariz. filed Jan. 23, 2019): a UA professor challenges Arizona’s categorical exclusion of gender-affirming surgical care under its state employee health insurance plan.

For each case discussion, you will be assigned one of two different roles:

- *Pump Primer*: As a pump primer, you will be asked to read the assigned case. You will then either write an initial post (roughly 500–700 words) or record a video presentation (roughly 7–10 minutes) in which you will provide an initial response to the issue raised by the case. I will provide instructions tailored to each discussion topic. The pump primer’s post is due to the discussion board each **Sunday by 11:59pm**.
- *Discussant*: Most students will contribute to the discussion by responding to a pump primer’s post or replies by classmates. As a discussant, you are not expected to read anything assigned to the pump primer. But you should write at least one reasonably elaborated reply (two short paragraphs or one long paragraph) that engages critically with the *substance* of the issue. There are many ways you can do this. For example, you can raise an objection to an argument (e.g., “Ana argues for A on the grounds that B, but B is false, and here is why”), provide a further consideration that doesn’t seem to have drawn enough attention (e.g., “we’ve been talking about A and B, but I want to suggest that C is also relevant because D”), elaborate on someone else’s point (e.g., “Quinn points out A, and I think that’s a really important issue in light of B”), defend an argument against an objection (e.g., “Toby doesn’t agree with Summer’s argument for A, but I believe Summer is right and here’s what they could say in response”), or offer your original argument (e.g., “some of us have argued for A by appealing to B, C or D; even though the rest of us don’t agree, we can all agree that E is true, and I think E is enough for making A true”). And if you notice a classmate’s point has not been picked up by anyone, try to respond to it first. The discussant’s reply is due the following **Tuesday by 11:59pm**.

You will be required to be a pump primer for one topic and a discussant for the five others. You must sign up for discussion roles by **Thursday, July 6, at 11:59pm** (first come, first choice!). Your post as a pump primer will make up 10% of your final grade, and your five posts as a discussant another 15%.

### Take-Home Final Exam

There will be a comprehensive take-home final exam consisting of short answer and short essay questions. The short answers question will ask you to explain basic concepts, arguments, and issues covered in this class, and the short essay questions will provide opportunities for you to apply your knowledge to novel cases.

The exam will be open book and open notes. You are encouraged to study for the exam together, but what you turn in should be your own. If any idea or language comes from a classmate, you should acknowledge it properly, just as you would in an essay.

I will distribute the final exam on Monday, August 14. It will be due on the university-scheduled exam day, **Friday, August 18 by 11:59pm**.

The take-home final exam will make up 45% of your final grade.

## Late Assignments, Extensions, and Make-ups

No late assignments will be accepted, but an extension will ordinarily be granted as long as you (1) have a clear plan for completing the assignment and (2) let me know your plan by email **no later than 6 hours before the deadline** (unless the delay is justified). Likewise, there is no need to show me any kind of documentation.

As an instructor, I always appreciate students asking for extensions ahead of time when possible. Make-ups for missed assignments after the fact are generally disfavored, and will be granted only to accommodate emergencies and other unexpected circumstances, such as physical (including mental) health, child care, family emergencies, and military duty. We can always work something out, but it’s important that you contact me as soon as you can.

## Academic Integrity

### Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See <http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity>.

### Plagiarism

**I view plagiarism as a *very* serious violation of the university’s Code of Academic Integrity, and you should as well.** I strongly encourage you to review this helpful guide prepared by the university library: <https://new.library.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism>. I understand different instructors may draw the line somewhat differently; if you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism for the purposes of our course, please don’t hesitate to ask me.

### Inappropriate Use of Class Notes and Course Materials

**Disseminating class notes or course materials beyond the classroom community, such as selling them to other students or to a third party for resale, is strictly prohibited.** Violations to this rule are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA email to sell or buy such notes or course materials are subject to Student Code of Conduct violations for misuse of student email addresses. This misconduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

## (Lack of) Diversity in Philosophy

Unfortunately, philosophy as an institutionalized discipline is remarkably white, cis male, straight, able-bodied, and middle-class. This lack of diversity is often apparent just from the topics and authors typically taught in introductory philosophy courses. However, philosophy as a whole is becoming more and more diverse thanks to the efforts of several generations of philosophers. As a philosophy student, you can also help the profession address its diversity and inclusiveness problems by seriously engaging with minority authors and supporting your fellow minority students.

The American Philosophical Association (APA) has a useful handout for minority undergraduate students in philosophy, which you can read here: <https://www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/diversity/Advice_for_Undergrads.pdf>.

A valuable local opportunity is the Arizona Feminist Philosophy Graduate Conference organized annually by graduate students at the UA Department of Philosophy. The conference brings together graduate students working on feminist issues from around the country and the world. The recordings of many talks in the past are available freely on the conference website: <https://femphilaz.com>. You can earn up to 3 extra credit points on your final exam by watching any of the talks, writing a 1–2 page response paper, and emailing it to me by 11:59pm on Wednesday, August 16. You should spend roughly half of your response paper summarizing the argument presented in the talk and then the other half critically engaging with it (e.g., raise a problem, defend it against a worry, connect it to an idea or argument we discussed in class, apply it to a different context). A couple of talks that are particularly relevant to this class include Professor Connie Rosati’s 2020 keynote on *Obergefell* (the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case that declared bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional), Professor Gina Schouten’s 2021 keynote on liberal feminism, and Joan O’Bryan’s 2022 paper on Beauvoir, MacKinnon, and Butler. But you should feel free to pick any other one that you find interesting!

## Respect, Support, and Care for One Another

### Materials in This Course

Since many of the issues we will cover in this course are not only intellectually but also personally relevant, you might find it difficult to read and discuss certain course materials. I want to acknowledge that. It’s perfectly understandable.

It’s therefore important that we *respect*, *support*, and *care for* one another throughout the course. Please always feel free to talk to me if you anticipate certain topics will be especially difficult for you, or if you think the way they get discussed in the class is disrespectful or otherwise problematic.

### How to Respect, Support, and Care for One Another

Here are some concrete examples of how you can respect, support, and care for your classmates and instructor:

- Value everyone’s contribution to class discussions;
- Disagree in a way that takes other people’s ideas seriously and sincerely;
- Challenge remarks, jokes, and examples that are racist, sexist, heterosexist, cissexist, misogynistic, transmisogynistic, xenophobic, ableist, ageist, classist, etc.;
- Keep discussions inclusive by avoiding talking to only a few specific people;
- Be mindful of how your tone/meaning might not be accurately conveyed through your writing alone (for example, if your question might be misunderstood as a rhetorical one, it’s probably a good idea to indicate explicitly that it is a genuine question);
- Please use your go-by name as your display name and, *if* you feel comfortable and safe doing so, include your pronouns as well;
- Use the pronouns and name you are asked to when you refer to a person, and avvoid assuming a person’s pronouns, gender identity, or sexual orientation based on their appearance, voice, or name;
- Be careful not to disclose anyone’s gender identity or sexual orientation (i.e., out them) without their permission, even if they are already out in the classroom---it can put lives in danger;
- Never inquire about anyone’s genitalia, deadname, “before” photos, medical history, assigned gender at birth, sex life, and so on;
- Use inclusive language (for helpful examples, see <https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist> and <https://transjournalists.org/style-guide>).

If you feel any aspect of this course makes it difficult for you to participate fully, I want to know. This is *very* important to me.

### University Statements on Discrimination, Harassment, and Threatening Behavior

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimi-nation. In support of this commitment, the University prohibits discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex, national ori-gin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information. For more information, including how to report a concern, please see <http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy>.

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See <http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students>.
